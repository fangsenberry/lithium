Speaker A:
Is that unusual?

Speaker B:
Rather unusual, but it has happened some years.

Speaker A:
Where are the wolves coming from? The north?

Speaker B:
Yeah, usually but it's all over the country. It's not that often but they are probably swimming out to the island and it's not far from from the mainland.

Speaker A:
So they go to a specific island to winter or something.

Speaker B:
No coincidence. But there are a lot of sheep farmers here.

Speaker A:
Okay.

Speaker B:
And the terrible with wolves is if they go in somewhere they kill every animal, any animal. They don't eat them. All of them target just a few big but they kill all of them.

Speaker A:
Wow. So the dogs need to stay inside.

Speaker B:
But they are afraid of people. I've met wolves a lot of times here but they are just turning around so far. So far.

Speaker A:
Are you still riding?

Speaker B:
Yes.

Speaker A:
Is the weather still good enough?

Speaker B:
Yeah, it's good. It's been like late summer here now. It's been 20 almost every day here in September. It's very unusual.

Speaker A:
Should be cooler.

Speaker B:
Yeah, but of course it's snow in the north already.

Speaker A:
Yes, well the autumn has come.

Speaker B:
We haven't seen the autumn yet. Today was the 29 degree, which this is after almost end of the September and we still have about thirty s and up to the theater was arriving on Wednesday so we had about 35 for last what, 89 days. That never happened. 35 degrees has never happened in Stockholm area ever.

Speaker A:
Well, that's good.

Speaker B:
Hope it stays that way. That happens and we're really in the trouble.

Speaker A:
Any new updates from you from around there?

Speaker B:
Here in Sweden?

Speaker A:
Sweden, northern Europe.

Speaker B:
Yeah, I say that as I said before, it's a problem now that you see mean suddenly we realize that we can't give as much as we want to Ukraine because we probably need it very big uncertainty and people realize that there is even if it's not a major risk, but it is a risk for war in this area.

Speaker A:
Is the situation between Poland and Ukraine expected? Because it seems rather emotional.

Speaker B:
Yeah, but I mean, you must understand even Poland is not a rich country and now suddenly they have to protect their own farmers they can't buy the wheat wheat from Ukraine anymore. And so there is because they're a member of the European Union european Union has said that allowed Ukraine that they should buy wheat from Ukraine and then the Poland had stepped out of that and said we can't do so. It's a difficult situation for both of.

Speaker A:
Them so they were probably dumping it a lot and the price was going low, I would imagine.

Speaker B:
Yeah. The situation in Ukraine doesn't make easy for any nations in right, right.

Speaker A:
I was just reading earlier about this situation between Poland and Ukraine and seems like hard words but you never know.

Speaker B:
Yeah, you never mean unfortunately there are not many but there's at least people who support Putin in and you never know what will happen in the next.

Speaker A:
Election here in Poland?

Speaker B:
In Poland? Yes.

Speaker A:
When is that coming?

Speaker B:
I don't remember, but it's quite soon. So we'll see what happens.

Speaker A:
Well, on my travel, I continue to think we have a misunderstanding about China. We'll hear what Lewis has to say this morning from his economic watch, but I just don't see it as negative economically as people are talking about.

Speaker B:
It's interesting to listen to that, because from here, from my point of view, I had no much ideas. I just see what I can read in the right, right. They just started each region, like Philip described me the other day about the provincial governance has more power. It's a republic. And each province has their own financial plan and budget. You can give to the depth to the companies and the SOEs and state owned companies and all those what I heard is they run out of the debt capability in the provincial government, but the central government has the capability for giving more money to the other people, I mean companies. So what they started to see within is they are moving those depth capability back to the center so that they can redistribute the money to those necessary sectors. So we'll see what happens. I will see what Mr. Lewis says, but apparently it looks like a difference. But you see, the German car industry is very upset now that are selling a lot of cars here in Europe, and it's probably because they're much cheaper. And what they do now is the Chinese government give money and are supporting the manufacturing of cars for the companies in but but I don't know, is that called cheating like you guys? I mean, in Europe it's definitely like that. We don't allow government to support private companies. But Japan did that. Japan still does. I see. The TSMC is a know the way explained. You got report from the Kayama, but they have their own room for developing the TSMC's development every day. So at the end of the day, they call how's the development going? How's the process, anything necessary? So, I don't know. Is that called the cheating? So that's the point of view that we have because we went through the Japan bashing days from the United States, and I remember we quoted 2.5 million cars a year or 2.6 million cars a year to export to the United States just because we're selling too much cars in the United States.

Speaker A:
Well, I just read a report this morning that 50% of the EV cars worldwide are now and the cost is very low.

Speaker B:
We're the hypocrites. We have lots of resources, like a diffume popping up from the South American earth and we just ship to China. Let them process it. Of course, lithium, iron and all those necessary materials is cheap in China because they can process. I think we have to rethink everything. What we think, what we see is probably different.

Speaker A:
Good morning, John. Afternoon. Jason. And Alvaro is on the road. I just wanted to say I just bought Alvaro. You were on mute, but I could see. Can you hear me? But I can only read your words.

Speaker B:
I'm sorry, I'm just in the middle of a pet. Always. We had one and a half hour delay here because of a thunderstorm and so I'm in the middle of nowhere.

Speaker A:
Well, that's okay. We can see you and hear you.

Speaker B:
Forget about me, I'll listen to you.

Speaker A:
Well, we were just talking about cars. So here you are in a car.

Speaker B:
It's my wife.

Speaker A:
Where are you heading off to?

Speaker B:
My son in turing.

Speaker A:
Oh wow, there is noise.

Speaker B:
OK, I can start again. John, you were saying? I was saying that my wife and I just bought a Toyota. Welcome to the Japanese community here. Yeah, and it's the highest value. It holds its value longer than any other going. I'm not going electric until they make me. I have a very old Toyota Hideax. It's a truck, diesel one. And somebody came up to me the other day, said they will pay me ¥2.5 million. That was the original cost about ¥1 million about 25 years ago.

Speaker A:
Nishan, good evening. It was great to see you the other day. And Sister Nilda. Thank you. And thanks for the notes you sent victor, I hear we're going to the event is on Tuesday.

Speaker B:
Yes.

Speaker A:
Look forward to that and we can chat about that later. And Tom Sato. Admiral Koto is great. We had a very nice dinner the other night. I hope you must have gotten home safely. Jonathan, great to see you again. Howard, good morning.

Speaker B:
Good morning. Phil.

Speaker A:
Makoto noto is that your friend, makoto? There we go.

Speaker B:
Sorry for returning. I can't hear me.

Speaker A:
No, we can hear.

Speaker B:
Oh, okay. Yes. Very nice to meet you. Thank you for inviting me. Okay, go ahead. Mr. Hamada.

Speaker A:
Yeah, maybe mr. Hamara, maybe Naoto could just introduce you briefly, makoto.

Speaker B:
Right now? Okay, sure. Hi. Makoto is my sort of craftsman. She was two years program and I was a one year literary senior program. I was older student probably she was one of the youngest students in L-K-Y Kwanu School in Singapore. So we were there back in 2008, 2007, I think. You were there until 2009, I believe. Currently I understand she's working at the Chamber of Japan researching for digital policy. Am I correct? And you can travel through this? We just recently regrouped with some another craftsman asked me to help her daughter to be in a backpack in Japan. I have no idea what the heck is backpacking in Japan. So I had to ask younger people. Now after 15 years, I'm not sure she can say compared to me. And she's still young, so I had to call her to find out if she knows how to backpack. Apparently she did help a little because she didn't know much about the backpacking. Nevertheless. So she's here, she has quite knowledge about the digital policy. So I hope she can comment something in the later when you have a chance to speak, please. Thank you. Makoto san.

Speaker A:
Just welcome makoto.

Speaker B:
Thank you very much, Mr. Mitrand and Mr. Naoto. And my name is Makoto and thank you for Mr. Hamada's nice introduction. And I work for Japan business Federation, K Dun in Japanese, it's the biggest economic organization in Japan and I believe it has kind of a political pleasure to Japanese government. And as he mentioned, I work for the team of digitalization in KDN Land and also I join in startup team. So I'm so excited to join here for the discussion maybe the future of digitalization and especially including all economics, politics, a lot of a wide range of topics. I hope to join this insightful discussion. Thank you.

Speaker A:
Well, welcome, makoto. I just returned 12 hours ago from Japan. I'm sorry, didn't have a chance to meet you, but we'll do that next time. Thank you and welcome everybody. I've just returned, as I just said, had great chance to meet Admiral Coda and another Navy associate, Admiral Fanata and Mr. Nishi and his office and several others, including Max, who's on the call. So it was a great chance to get together in the past week and we can talk more about that later.

Speaker B:
So.

Speaker A:
My own once again coming back from China especially, I'm sorry to say to some of you that look at the numbers, but the numbers just don't say doom and gloom when you go into China. I just don't see it. So I don't see disillusioned people and I definitely don't see economy that appears to be struggling. So with that said, Lewis, if you could open this morning and just give us really what you are seeing from the numbers because we'd like to hear the picture coming from there, if that's okay. So, Lewis, good morning or good evening. Good afternoon, I guess good afternoon.

Speaker B:
First of all, guys, important day for all Irish people and South Africans, Japanese colleagues, you'll be always interested because you beat us in the last Rugby World Cup. I was there for the beating we got. And so Ireland play South Africa. Ireland are number one in the world in rugby. And today we play South Africa, who look like the real number one. The game is on, I think at 08:00 London time. And if you have an Irish bar anywhere near you, I guarantee that any Irish guy that has any Irish blood in them will be at the game. And I suggest you all make your way and have a few beers because there will be proper fun and excitement with all the Irish guys there. Okay, that aside, one of the things that we've been discussing over the last couple of weeks is the rise in global debt. And there is an equivalent response in terms of interest rates. So we had a meeting from the Federal Reserve this week. They've hiked interest rates, I think it's eleven or twelve times. They've skipped a beat. Once this week they skipped a beat. But the forward projections for interest rates basically suggest that the Federal Reserve are going to keep interest rates higher for longer. And there was a significant market reaction in terms of interest rates. The benchmark for the cost of money globally is US tenure yields, and that is now trading a shade under 4.5%. And you need to keep an eye on that number, because any further on the upside will be a significant problem for the global economy. One of the things that you're all seeing is that for particularly my Japanese colleagues, dollar Yen is trading at ¥150 to the dollar. That's a big number. The bank of Japan demurred this week and said that they would continue with their quantitative easing policy. For me personally, I think that that's a recipe for disaster. Japanese capital flow is everywhere in the world. You've exported your savings pool. Asians, traditionally not just Japanese, but Chinese, Singaporeans, Thai, Indonesians have a much higher savings rate than the average saver in the G 20. And that savings pool has been exported around the world, but into global assets. If Japanese interest rates, which have moved now to 70 basis points and are starting to edge higher, there's some kind of playoff. I think that where the yen continues to weaken and it precipitates a sell off in Japanese government bond market. To set some context, Jesper is not on the call today. Jesper believes that the yen will trade at ¥220 to the dollar, which is in the lexicon of history of yen. Again, for people in markets like myself, Dollar Yen, the last time it was trading at that kind of level was way back in the very early seventy s. The implication Japanese interest rates, the yen starting to weaken, might create a problem perception problem about the size of government debt in Japan held by the bank of Japan. It's a Ponzi scheme. So the government issues the debt, the bank of Japan buys the debt and basically continues to print money at Infiniteland. But if the yen continues to weaken, there may be a tipping point where A, Japanese interest rates explode, b as a result of that, Japanese take all their capital away from the rest of the world, and that would be a real problem. So what I'm trying to describe to you right now is that US has a $30 trillion budget deficit. It's rising by trillions on a weekly basis. Japan, basically nearly half of the government debt is owned by the bank of Japan. And you can see this kind of evolving circle of monetization of debt where a central bank authority continues to buy the government paper and sooner or later we're starting to see the bond markets start to demand a premium for the risk that they're taking on in government debt. Japan is a particular case in point. Anybody I know who's been in markets howard, you've been in markets longer than me, but they call it the widowmaker, is that there is no guy in New York, Geneva, or London who hasn't, in their long track record of trading markets, hoped or prayed for a sell off in the Japanese government bond market. So we're watching interest rates in general, but we're watching very carefully what might happen if Japanese interest rates, the bank of Japan, lose control there, number one, I think so that's a big weight hanging over global markets right now. There is some positive this week. I don't know what's happened. Mr. Gao, our colleague from China, raised a .5 or six months ago where basically the message was phil, maybe you can paraphrase it was stop falling and stabilize, I think was the terminology that Mr. Gao used. There is certainly, from what I can see, first of all, in terms of the policy response in China, the world is looking for a big fiscal stimulus. In 2008, 2009, when the world was on its knees as a result of global financial crisis, china enacted a massive stimulus package which helped stabilize the world. Today, China hasn't delivered. What they've been doing is piecemeal approach, kind of putting Band AIDS on the bond market, band AIDS on the currency, band AIDS on the property market. They're slowly stitching things up. My personal view is that a stimulus measure or package from China will not happen until the US signaled that their interest rate hikes are done. They don't have to start cutting, but the Fed needs to signal that they no longer have a bias to hike their interest rates. Why is this the case? It's counterproductive if you have a stimulus package in China, on one side fighting against dollar strength, on the other, the dollar strength comes from the Fed hiking interest rates. So I think one of the things that we're starting to see, we saw some very positive comments from Miss Yellen, the US. Treasury Secretary. She's highly respected in China. So Jake Sullivan went to China four or five months ago or six months ago, consistent with Mr. Gao's comments about stabilizing in the equation. I'm starting to see conciliatory noises in terms from the US administration acknowledging that China has no bias for an invasion in Taiwan, starting to see similar type comments from some Chinese officials as well. From my perspective, the picture I'm trying to create is, and I've said this over the last two or three weeks, we're getting to the cliff edge. And both the American and Chinese administrations realize what Elon Musk was saying, that we are symbiotically aligned with each other. And the process was now starting to push markets over the edge. So we're a very important inflection point both in interest rates and geopolitics. And rather than having big risk positions, I think it behooves everybody to sit back and wait for things to kind of stabilize and calm down. And that's what I'm very focused on. So measures announced yesterday between the US. Treasury and Chinese Ministry of Finance PBOC, a working group to deal with financial services that I think is a major positive in the equation. Comments from Miss Yellen during the week that says basically linking the national security issue and delinking from China but not decoupling from China. Those are very positive comments. And why they're positive is that America realizes that there is a turning point or a point at which they continue to push China. And China has a number of tail risks that will blow back on the American economy. So in general terms, watching debt levels, watching US interest rates at 4.5%, can we stay below that? Can we see if interest rates in the US stabilize? The Fed signals at some stage over the next couple of weeks and months that they're nearly done. And I would just point out, bank of England didn't hike this week. The Swiss National Bank didn't hike this week. The ECB hiked interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this week and then said that they were done. So all the other central banks in the lexicon of central banking are getting to a point now where they feel that their economies are they've controlled inflation enough. And the downside for them is that the economies are starting to slow. So what I'm hoping for is that we're starting to see some reason between the US. And the Chinese that the Feds start to signal that interest rates are near or near the top, the dollar starts to top out, and that will be a positive environment for stocks and interest rates, stocks in general, but not the time to have huge positions. And just one final observation. This miracle of AI. The marketeers have made a bunch of money in the last six to nine months on stories like Nvidia and stocks like this. And there's all kinds of metrics that people are using to try and indicate that maybe we've come too far. Phil highlighted a number of stories this morning I think Jesper also highlighted. We're now starting to see the real generational impact of AI on markets. Just SoftBank floated. Arm holdings, which is a UK based chip manufacturer, a was expected because of its exposure to China not to perform well. It exploded out of the gates. That negative sentiment has pulled Nvidia back, pulled Armholdings back 25% from its peak on its issuing day. My bottom line story is that every dip you see in ETFs related to AI, major stocks related to AI, this is an opportunity set. When you see Arm Holdings pull back 25% in two days, it just shows you how speculative the market is. And the opportunity set is a multi year, multigenerational thing. And we're only at the start of this, and people who tell you that AI is overvalued, are talking out of their heads. So that's my take for the moment. If anybody has any questions on any of the stuff that I post on the Discord Channel, I'm always open to conversation. Just one final point. Enkem introduced me to his young son who is finishing university at the moment, and he's doing a degree in finance. I had a hour long conversation with Nkem's son. He is a total credit to his dad. He was a lovely character and I'm going to try and help him connect him with some of the people that I know in markets. That's it for me today.

Speaker A:
Thanks a lot. Many things to take on from there. Lois. Let me just say, as we are having this conversation, xi Jinping is opening the Asian Games in Hangzhou and it's quite the event. Mr Gao is not on the call tonight or today because of that event. It's a national event and many countries are there, so the beat goes on in China is sort of my message. And so with that, Alex, if you could add some comment. I also just read an interview with Dr Kissinger where he said the US and China have to come to terms and work together on AI, which was a very interesting injection at this point. For Alex, please.

Speaker B:
Thanks. I don't have a very long sharing because I'm still digesting some of the information. But I think the very key things that echo what Luis has shared, which is very valuable. Looking from the data perspective of what we already see from our side, the first question is always that especially the Chinese and some of the Asian is asking us this question, said, why would Chinese want to save the world? Again, because the previous round didn't turn out well for China and they did try to save the world using their reserve and everything. So this is the second time round and basically they asked the questions, they said, especially the world is being screwed by the Western capitalists, so why would they want to do that? No clear reason for it. Of course, you can always say that the world, everybody is conjoined twin and then joining at the hip. And, yeah, if one die, everybody die. But fundamentally, there's another look at it and say, who will die first? China. In my own understanding, that economy is not dying, they're still doing all right and they can turn back pretty quickly because it's a policy driven economy, as I mentioned. And the China advantage is that they don't really have opposition. Right? It's a night of democracy that any policy they want to push, any rule in the push, there will always be people shouting from the other side and you take a very long time for you to settle there. So very important. I mean, for Phil, some of our colleagues that already been to China, you'll probably be able to see, very important thing we understand what is going on in China, but most importantly is that you really have to understand the culture and the language. So with that you begin to read what their conversations are and to understand that people who only consume the Western media actually miss out a very large part of it. You may not know what exactly happened, but listen to the people conversation. Eventually you will understand that hey, it is not as gloomy as what the Western media painted it to be. Which brings me to the third point as what Luis mentioned about the AI. The real danger may not be the AI, but actually it is a market here who promote and hype the AI. In order for the market, the people in the market try to make some quick bucks. Ultimately, if we understand, or rather remember the history, AI was up and down three times, it was being hiked three times and fell flat and then come back again. This is the only time that AI have so much promise because of. So everybody begins oh yeah, it's finally arrived. Is it really? But I think the real danger for AI is actually not about generative AI, but it is about the AI agent. The AI agent begins. We really think that it is able to communicate with each other. It will operate, do purchase and a lot of the time we do not know the transaction was done by AI or human. I think that is becoming so called a real danger. It's not necessarily the generative AI that can misinform people. I think that is a part of things. I think we need to begin to start looking at that. And the government cannot be working alone to come up with policy. There is two things that emerging. I think Luis also highlighted that in the chat. The first one is about the cryptocurrency regulation. Cryptocurrency by itself is a very funny thing because that cryptocurrency blockchain, it works when it is distributed and that is a purpose supposed to be distributed. There should be no government, all right? The system, the network, manage it and go by the formula, go by the rule. But look at what happened is that the central banks and everybody tried to control it and there's always this divergent and there's always this force going on. So will the decentralized, what's a call property of the blockchain continue? I think most of the people don't give two foot about it because number one, the crypto that currently at play is a lot of them are scammed, but mostly for speculators to play. So if under G 20 there is a possibility to come up with a dignified rule and regulation, that may be good. It will be something that clarify a lot of things. But having said that, it become an oxymoron because a centralized G 20 trying to what would everybody do? Centralized crypto? Crypto by itself is actually very difficult to be centralized if you use it correctly. All right. And bullishing can always be difficult. That is where most of government is trying to drive it to centralized. So we are definitely seeing the force moving to site and exactly where it will end, we do not know. So I'm looking at the technical part of it, unless on the finance part of it because finance part is actually very simple. It's just making buy low, sell high, the kind of concept and somebody hype up and somebody just got food. So that is the kind of situation for most of the crypto. Real application for the crypto is still quite far away. Now, having said that and having understand that, then we look at the same thing for AI. I previously mentioned that there are more people working there are more people working on applying AI than people working on regulating AI. The regulation is still look at generative AI, what it can do versus looking at AI agent right now and AI agent already emerged and AI agent already work very well right now. So you can say that the current version of the regulation that UK or whoever may come up with will be at least a few years late compared to what will be on the market. Now. This is a thing that we have to collectively be mindful of and this is collectively we have to figure out what we can do to address all these things. Now, turning back to one of the articles that Bill posts in the chat is about China and us setting up two committees to start having a dialogue. We may think that it is a softening of stance of it, but collecting and observing from the Asian context and especially listening to some of the chapter happened, is that most of the people looking at these two committee, they are pretty indifferent. That means that they don't really care about these two committee. It seems that this is what the west want to have the dialogue to understand the east, but the east don't care about oh, you want to talk? Fine, we just talk. Am I going to tell you and coordinate how to move forward? Probably not. We have our direction, we're going to move this way. If you want, you can come along, but you are not invited. And that is the kind of conversation, that's the kind of standard I'm hearing largely over the inside. Now, this potentially may give the illusion for the west to say oh, China would like to talk. In reality, is that okay, just come along. This is a very different thing only when you understand the language and the nuance. So my advice is very simple is that I think we need to have more people who understand both sides and then all this sharing and knowledge can be propagated. It is quite scary to look at when one side don't really care about. The other side and just go ahead and move forward. The world is fragmented and we have to recognize that that is what make our world very unique. It's impossible to push one side idea and expect everybody to adopt it. Everybody is different. Once we understand that, once we are able to accept that. I think when you look back, okay, United Nations doesn't work right now. Sachi also because the west is trying to push its ideology to everybody and it may not work for everybody. So we see that the situation in Africa and that is where the and we see that in Global South and everybody get more vocal ultimately that now the world is definitely moved towards a multipolar situation. I think more than two years ago we talked about tcpm trust and confidence building measure. It didn't work. It fell flat on our face. We tried to work on the project. Eventually we end up that didn't complete what we are supposed to. Primary reason is because that basically the time is two years ago is pretty much seen as a unipolar world. One person say, I mean, one side say and the rest of them will just basically say yes sir, yes, sir, three backpack. But the world changed right now and the Global South as a very typical example that we are seeing that you're more vocal and say that, look, I'm not going to care what you say. And that very, very important for us to start building Tcpn. The question is that how are we going to do it, number one? Number two, okay, let me be very blunt and ask this question. Is United States agreement ready that we are able to build the tcpm a lot of time? I don't think so. And then we have to go through a period of transitions. This will be very chaotic for this transition. And anytime that we can step on somebody else's hidden red line, then something bad could happen. Well, with that, let's hand you back to Phil. Thanks.

Speaker A:
Thank you very much, Alex. Sally, are you with us today on a clear connection? Because if so, the item that's jumped out on everybody, at least in the west the last few days is India. So in the context of the digital interface that we're talking about and now surprises at least to the west like thought and then the regulation that's in play in Sri Lanka right now. So Sally, if you could make a few comments. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Hi, Phil, thank you so much. Just to touch base on what's happening in Sri Lanka right now. A couple of days ago, the Internet Safety Bill was proposed by the government of Sri Lanka under the patronage of the President Ranil Vikramasinga. And to give you a snapshot of what the historical view was like probably in 2014 and I was involved significantly in the 2015 presidential election and so on and so forth. The 2015 presidential election was probably one of the global case studies where presidential election won solely on Facebook, right? So we have a history of terrorism, as you know, that last 30 years of civil war and the LTT terrorism. And in the advent of the digital media from Facebook to the other applications, we have seen serious incidents of fake news and manipulations and many Ponchi schemes on internet and all sorts of things have happened in the past. So internet safety bill is required in my opinion. But the form that they have put the bill is I'm looking at it is draconian. And it might not be pragmatic as well in my view, because President appoints a five member committee under his purview and those five committee has the sole decision making power to figure what is wrong and what is right in terms of news. So, given the history of wrong people in the most important executive presidency state in my lifetime, I have seen that the nepotism, the corruption on the manipulations and lies reigning in Sri Lankan politics and Sri Lankan culture given that Sri Lanka is only 22 million people, and out of that 22 million people, there's a diaspora of 2 million people outside, right? So according to this act, even a Sri Lankan living in Sri Lanka or person living overseas and they want to monitor and penalize for fake news and the wrong information and against national security, against people. So therefore they would not be able to find a middle ground at least to figure it out like what this act is all about, how it will impact the life of Sri Lankans, how the information to be received and engaged. So my view is that it will be very hard to apply this act on its own form that they have presented it. So there's a huge uproar in Sri Lanka right now against the bill. I'm sure that there will be few activists will go to the Supreme Court to move the Supreme Court against this bill and the public discourse have started and said draconian and it would not be good for democracy in state. Unfortunately, President Vikramasingha been a champion of free speech and freedom of speech and the democracy in the country for the past 46 years of his political life is getting the plaque for it. I'm not quite sure whether he's aware with the whole concept of this internet security bill. I'm not quite sure about that. I don't have information on that. But that's a huge approval even politically. It's manipulated right now, this whole narrative, given the fact that I've been in control or have significant influence in the political narrative, in the digital space especially, this is going to hurt a lot of people. It's going to hurt a lot of people because there is a lot of activity going on the YouTube channels and they are earning money. We are talking about the digital economy. President Kamsing has taken a leap forward on the digital economy. He's talking about it. So given that you want to control the space of information, in my view, it will be a catastrophe if you go on the same form. But yes, internet security bill is important, but the way that it's been presented in my view is draconian. I would not be able to go and speak because somebody else who don't like me and actually take me to manipulate the whole narrative when I even get into the custody because the committee designs the jail term is five years, right? And with a fine. We have a history of the journalists being killed, assassinated, the political assassinations and the character assassination. This going to be in my view, it's going to be a tough task for the government to go ahead and implement it because you have to go to the parliament and get at least 113 votes. I'm not quite sure, given the divisive politics that what's happening right now in the country. Because the President, Vikrama Singh in the parliament has only one seat because he's been voted in the parliament constitutionally and therefore that maybe there are a lot of talk going on against this bill and the people who can narrate this story to the public will win this game. We need to understand that Sri Lanka has about 16 million voters. Out of that, 6 million people are under 40 within the age group of 18 to 40. So these 6 million people are in digital. Right. So if you control the platforms, if you control the information, what is out there, it will be a political suicide, in my view. Thank you so much.

Speaker A:
Thank you. Salia. So, following on with that divinda, now looking at the picture largely in South Asia and the surprise to many of us this week in India, if you could make some comments. Devinda is not feeling great this morning so he's going to be on audio only. But Devinda, please.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Phil. Good day to all. The highlight of India hosting the G 20 and its recognition and arrival on the world stage as a major power regional as well as growing globally was a significant accomplishment. There was reference to Ukraine watered down, such as it was, but the G 20 got through a successful summit in New Delhi this week's. News of course, is the accusations by the Canadian Prime Minister of assassinations by Indian diplomats of Canadian citizens. It'll be very challenging to monitor this situation as it develops. The Indian Sikh diaspora community in Canada is extensive. They've had a history in India of trying to push for separatism. The Golden Temple in India was attacked by there was a military operation that was conducted to tear it out of separatist radicals in the 1980s which triggered the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her own Sikh bodyguards in 1985. There's also been series of aircraft bombings that originated in Canada, including aircraft on the tarmac at Narita airport which the bomb exploded on the ground and a bomb that was put on board a flight from Montreal to Delhi that exploded in midday on an Air India flight that killed 300 some people off the Irish coast. It's been a very nasty negative history between Canada and the Sikh community and their activities out of Canada targeting the Indian government as well as Indian aircraft. That does not in any way justify if there has been such activities in killing a Sikh activist in Canada. This will develop into a major issue for New Delhi to deal with. Our colleague Ram Madhav has written an op ed today on this, basically saying that Canada has to make a decision and pick a side, whether they stand for violence or for peaceful resolution of these conflicts. But it certainly has taken a shine off of India's G 20 success and we'll have to see how this evolves going forward. Thank you.

Speaker A:
Thank you Davinda. And of course in the digital environment, that can go anywhere quickly. Jerry Halton, you just have returned from a very interesting trip and you suggested to me be appropriate to review it a bit. The point is Ukraine, so jerry, please.

Speaker B:
Thank you Phil, and hello to everyone. I was in Washington for the last week and for the last two days in a summit on the reconstruction finance of Ukraine. So they assembled at one of the big think tanks. About 250 both US companies and about 25 Ukrainian officials came over, often in the digital field, but in finance and actually all of the government two or three things came out of this that I think will interest everyone. One is that it seems to be an undercurrent that the war will at least last until 2024 unless there's some surprise breakthrough and there's not anticipated, it's hard to see what that surprise breakthrough is. It could be cutting off the land route to Crimea, but that's a real stretch. So the war goes on. There's beginning to be written in the defense journals a name for this, which is a broken back war. The view that both sides are unable to secure victory. Essentially there's parity on precision weapons, parity on force, as long as you don't go nuclear. This ends up with what's called broken back war. So broken back war goes on. So that's one. Two is the Ukrainians were quite positive about how much production is actually taking place in Ukraine. We focus a lot on the war zone, but a good bit of the country is operating and a lot of the numbers are quite positive and they've learned not to live under a condition of war. So productivity is going up. So there was a message of that we're open for business, that we're capable of doing business. That was tempered by another view though that the risk of war was keeping American corporations out and until someone created some type of war insurance, world bank or others, companies would find it hard to go in and really set up major operations under the current conditions. But there are examples in the west, especially of Ukraine, of significant investments being made, new infrastructure being built that is quite significant. I'll just give you one example. A young entrepreneur has built a transfer port on the western border of Ukraine that transfers cargo from the railroad gauge of Ukraine, which is the Soviet gauge, to the cars with the European gauge slightly narrower. And it's turned into a massive operation. So you're beginning to get alternatives to going out through the Black Sea seaports. But two, you also saw more and more that Ukraine is beginning to open up position in the Black Sea. Some of these places where Russia had radar and capacity in the Black Sea have been taken out, saw the attack on the naval headquarters. So the Black Sea is also coming into a more open position. So that's two, but 3 may be the three is the interesting one for me. You saw Biden appointed a woman named Penny Pritzker to be the head of reconstruction for Ukraine. Penny Pritzker is from a very wealthy family, immigrants from Ukraine. Over 140 years ago, wealthy family in Chicago, she was Secretary of Commerce, quite active as secretary. Had a sign on her door that said Open for business. She now heads reconstruction. So she came and spoke. It's only been in office a week. And here was her message. We're not waiting for the end of the war to reconstruct. Ukraine reconstruction starts now. So that message was echoed by the head of USAID and the White House National Security Advisor with the economic assignment for Ukraine. So it's clearly a message from the White House that we are not waiting for this war to end, to begin building the post war infrastructure, economy, et cetera. Now, that's ambitious. It may be harder to do than just the words. But the other point that began to be clear is Ukraine was ahead of the west. US. For instance, on digital economy, they claimed that a good bit of their digital techniques were what Estonia used to become. The Estonia now is 95% digital, everything's digital. Ukraine says, we're the ones who actually created and invented and programmed these products, and Estonia used them, and we know how to use them. So they picture a much more digital economy, one where, as they point out, you can be in a bomb shelter and still do business. So you keep the economy going while you live in the midst of war. So there's a series of things. The war goes on. There's more economic activity than the west conveys. Three, America is going to start reconstruction now. And fourth, the role of digital economy most likely makes this reconstruction much different. So I pushed for this picture. I'd be glad to get some people over time to comment on it. Instead of building a you could build a digital economy that is pretty much like the existing economies. Power lines are above ground, communication lines and stations are pretty much above ground. You can see them. What if you built a new infrastructure that was enabled to be harmed by kinetic war? That is, you can't bomb it, you can't find it. So you bury the power lines, you lace them into a network that if one line is cut, it transfers easily to others. You do the same thing with comms. Every major building has four or five levels below ground, full of Wi Fi, full of capacity to work. You begin to build, like South Korea did, a set of gates and traps that make it hard for the enemy's tanks or major force to come across your roads. You design the whole country to accept the fact that you're going to be attacked and then that acts as a deterrent to attack and also allows you to survive if you're attacked. So I think the rebuild may be quite different than traditional rebuilding and being an opportunity for to understand how do you have deterrent effect in a nuclear world. We've seen you don't go to nuclear war, but you do end up with pretty grievous kinetic warfare, traditional warfare and we're going to have to design systems that can live in that and deter invasion. And finally, I think there's a belief that in the US at least, that Ukraine has given a signal to China that Taiwan may be harder than you think. And you may want to have second thoughts about what you do with Taiwan because Russia has been unable a land bridge, straight physical connection to win this war. So therefore, how would China do this if they've got to cross a 60 1 mile body of water? So a lot of interesting conversations in DC.

Speaker A:
Thanks very much Jerry, for sharing all of that with us. Peter, you had your hand up.

Speaker B:
Thanks Bill. I want to respectfully disagree with some of the things that Jerry heard. Not because he's wrong, but because I think there are three Black Swans looming in Ukraine. The first black swan is North Korea. It turns out that although the ammunitions that North Korea will turn over to the Russians don't upset the parody that Jerry described, the reality of it is that they will provide a dominant ability for Russia to create real havoc throughout Ukraine just because of the nature of the ammunition that the North Koreans will likely supply. So that's sort of a Black Swan right now is what the role of China and North Korea will be in the conflict going forward. The second one, which I mentioned last week and everyone's aware of because it's public, is Starlink. When the book gets written about Ukraine, starlink will emerge as the single most important force multiplier for the Ukrainian military and holding the positions that they've been able to sustain and what Elon Musk does and what kinds of pressure are brought to bear on Starlink from all sides, the Russians, the Ukrainians, the Americans. It's way above my pay grade. But I will tell you that without Starlink, Ukraine would be losing this war. And with Starlink, I actually believe that is actually has advantageous, advantage over Russia and is not just at parity, as Jerry's colleagues said, but actually enjoys a significant technical advantage. And then the third thing I wanted to point out was that to Jerry's point about production is that it became public this week that the drones that are hitting Moscow, which I'm sure everyone's seen news about, that are actually the result of a public private partnership in Ukraine where literally a Ukrainian comedian raised over $100 million to self develop long range drones. And those drones, working with the Ukrainian MOT, have proven to be incredibly effective. And remember, they have to dodge, they have to go through all the Russian jamming and everything like that. But the point is that this was a public private partnership that has created something that I don't think anyone really saw as a capability of the private sector in Ukraine. So, to Jerry's point, there is a vibrant tech production capacity inside Ukraine that's being brought to bear against the Russians in ways that have surprised everyone. I want to say one thing in support of something that Lewis and Alex alluded to about the future of AI. It was Bill Gates famous quote said, people always overestimate what can be done in a year and underestimate what can be done in ten years. So I want to weigh in strongly with Lewis that we're at release 0.1 of what AI is going to unveil. And he's also right. If you look at Tesla as an example, tesla made an announcement that their new Dojo supercomputer will be used to aid computer vision and perception experiments. And Tesla stock gained the value of BMW in one day. So that's just a speculative bubble. That doesn't mean that this supercomputer isn't going to be amazing and there will be other amazing computers. But I'm not sure I'd be a buyer of Tesla stock because it's worth more than BMW in one day. But I would agree strongly with Lewis and Alex that the future of AI is yet to be seen. And so to give you two little hints that you can try one on your own and one will have to wait. One will have to wait. Is OpenAI announced yesterday, I guess, that they are taking their image production system called Dali, which you can access now, and they've integrated it into Chat GPT. So what this means is, if you want to create a deep fake and of course Open Eye is saying, don't worry, we'll police the deep fakes, but you can now Chat in Chat GPT and integrate an AI created image with AI created text. So the initial reviews of that it's only available to beta testers, and I'm not a beta tester for that particular product, but the reviews have been kind of mind boggling about what happens when you're able to integrate text and image using AI in a very simple interface open to all consumers. So stay tuned for that. You'll be seeing it in the next month or two, and it's going to be mind blowing. And then the other thing I want to mention is Pimize, P-I-M-E-Y-E-S which I tried for the first time this week and scared the hell out of me. So what Pimize does is you put in an image of a person. It could be a person you know or a person you don't know, and it basically scans the Internet and returns to you the identity of that person. So you can imagine the incredibly scary and pernicious implications of using Pimis. Now, there was a separate product available only to law enforcement and government that does the same thing, and now there's a product that's available to all of you. So give it a try. I think it costs like $5 a search or something. I searched on myself, by the way, and I found it really interesting. Next I'll be searching on Howard Morgan, so that should be really exciting for me. Anyway, I just thought I wanted to give that perspective. Phil, I'll go back on mute. Thank you very much.

Speaker A:
Thank you very much, Peter. So Admiral Kota and I had dinner. I forget when it was. I think it was Thursday evening, and we discussed the President Putin and Kim Jong UN meeting in the context of Ukraine and other matters. So I think just based on some of the things brought up, admiral Kota, maybe you could reflect on that a little bit. There's still a practical nature of war. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Yes. Just touching upon that subject, just some thoughts on Jerry's comment on cross straight and landing. The US and Japan one of the closest allies in this world. That 75 years ago. We are in a very fierce comeback. And Japan lost more than 50 islands to US landing forces. All Japan failed to protect all the Japanese occupied island to the US forces, marines supported by army and Naval Air Force, navy carrier forces. And my point is, really, many people say the Xi Jinping's attempt to the Taiwan, yes, he has objective, clear objective. But real military execution is not so easy. I think one of the closest example during World War II was Okinawa. What happened before Okinawa was US. Military US forces. It took two years and a half to take the whole sea control and air control around Okinawa. And then US had, I would say, 99.9 freedom to use sea and airspace and then made the landing. The only way for Japan to oppose that was attacking the US forces by Kamikaze. Most of them are rookie pilot, less than 200 flying hours. And Japan sorted out 200 and 2500 kamikaza against US forces, both carriers and landing forces. But today let's think about how China is able to maintain the sea control and air control around Taiwan for certain time of period, which really supports the Chinese physical military landing. Very difficult. And also Japan would be attacked. But Japan still has some capability to cooperate together with US forces. So really it's not free landing for China. How to get the real functioning air and sea control around the Taiwan will be very difficult. And also for the US landing forces, about 150,000 landing forces and Japanese forces were about 110,000. And US there were about 340 supporting forces around that. And it took two months and a half for the US forces to occupy the only mainland of now size of Taiwan is six times as large as that. And the size of the Taiwanese forces, including the reserve 1.6 million, okinawa only eleven and 110,000. Of course, Taiwan will be heavily damaged. But China one point I'd like to say based on Japanese experience is equation for Beijing is not so simple. Too many complicated equations for China to solve. But my point is that for sure Xi Jinping will do that. So how to prepare for that? But my point is we have many advantages. That's one thing for all of you. The bitter experience of Japan during the World War II in terms of the land invasion and island defense. But when we speak about Taiwan invasion or Taiwan defense, I think today there are so many new elements. We have just discussed digital AI, many different domains, space, but that would help a lot. But still one viewpoint of a Ukraine war is still the physical and kinetic destruction is one of the decisive and determining factors. So we have to take those new elements and conventional elements into account and think about Taiwan. And we have to think about how to protect. And also North Korea, the Russian Putin and Kim Jong UN. You know, they say some media says Putin wanted to have to get larger amount of ammunitions from the North Korea. But I as a former highest commander of the Japanese naval forces, transferring the ammunition we have to other country is the last thing for me to do because I have a largest task to protect our country. And especially in case of North Korea there, every day they are on the highest alert to prepare for these South Koreans supported by US forces in Korea conflict. So North Korea military easily trade their very precious ammunitions with something else less likely. That's what I think. Of course, if the Putin provides much valuable things to North Korea, there would be something, some compromises. But I don't think the transfer of the huge amount amount of diamond would not happen. But you know, there are several other things. But at the same time, what Putin want, I think Putin wants the soldiers. And North Korea is very famous for providing working forces to many foreign countries to get the hard currency, the US. Dollars. But just the CNN report two or three weeks ago, when we think about the casualties and the Russian soldiers killed in action, they already lost twice as large as the whole Self Defense Force of Japan. And the size of Japan population is about the same as Russia. And Russia size of Japan population lost two times as large as the Self Defense Force. I think the service member strength will train in Russia would be one of the key things for putting to keep on fighting to the end of the 24 or perhaps into 25. So there might be pretty larger possibility for Putin to ask for Kim Jong UN. Please send your work forces not to Ukraine, but to Russia, and we'll train them as the fighting forces. That is kind of the scenario I can get. Of course, there are many other things, space and the nuclear. But my point is we have to think many things about the Russell North Korean relationship. There's no easy answer, but we have to make our best estimate based on the available public knowledge. That is my point. Thank you very much.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Ed Malcota and great to see you this week. Johan, before the call, we were discussing similar associated challenges, for instance, that you're seeing in northern Europe. We were specifically discussing Poland and Ukraine and the situation, but any comments you have to offer would be appreciated. Thank you.

Speaker B:
You have probably read about the situation between Ukraine and Poland and it's just because Poland is worried about their farmers now, because there is an agreement in European Union that we should buy from Ukraine wheat and Poland stopped it just to save their own production here. And Ukraine were a bit upset about it and reported this to European Union. So there is a conflict, you can say, between Poland and Ukraine. And this is things that happens during the war. And I mean, there is no one to blame because it's easy to understand both sides. So this is a question, and now we have heard some not serious, but started some discussions here in the northern countries here. How much equipment can we give to Ukraine because maybe we should need them ourselves in the long run. You know, what's happening in the war and how it ends, if it ends, and how aggressive Putin will continue to be. So these are the segments you get here right now. But to be honest, we still wanted to support Ukraine as much as we can, and we hope that most of the world will continue to do that. But on the other hand, I've said it before, I think will be just only supported by money and equipment and not get involved in the war, because now we are offering Ukraine people to win Europe's. War against Russia. So, just a small comment.

Speaker A:
Thank you, johan al Wilhelm, I think you're in Washington, so it's not too early, but would you like to offer some comment? Because clearly we have a more complicated global situation than a war in Ukraine, as reflected in many of these comments. So Al, please.

Speaker B:
The things that I've been focusing on most recently are the number of people that are kibitzing about the possibility of China ding taking major military action against Taiwan. And from a very practical standpoint, the admiral is right on target. It would be an extremely cost venture for China and one that is not even reasonable at this point or any time in the next number of reasonable years for China to undertake. Most of those that I have talked to who have been in this business for a long time have long come to the conclusion that it's not on Xi Jinping's list to take any kind of violent action against Taiwan. He's largely using this as a vehicle for controlling much of the relationship with the United States. There is a serious concern about, among those who do assessments of equipment, that the Chinese will continue to build their capabilities vis a vis Taiwan as the stated objective. But the reality is that whatever they build vis a vis Taiwan is more applicable to a broader Pacific use, such as the islands that they eventually filled in and armed. I think that a fair number of American government officials have misread and misunderstood the dynamics in the military arena. But I also do think it's necessary that they continue to tailor their forces to be able to do something if there was an accident. I think that the United States underestimates China's knowledge of what Russia is doing. They have been watching Russia for a long time, and I had a US. Government official recently tell me that she didn't think that China was knowledgeable about Russia. And I think that that is a gross misunderstanding. So there's lots of room for mistake on both sides in this process in terms of their understanding what's going on. Thank you, Phil.

Speaker A:
Thank you. Al Nisan, great to see you also this past week in Tokyo. And a point that Al just made is the potential for mistakes. So, overall, Nissan, if you could offer some comment for us. Thank you.

Speaker B:
For policy planners, it's always difficult to say that misunderstandings or mismanagement can easily happen, and that devastates the whole plan. Of course. For example, the China's military initiative towards Taiwan surely not easy, but at the same time, half Taiwan is prepared for that kind of difficult situation. What I'm anxious about, and what I'd like to know is half the infiltration of Chinese military excuse me, the Chinese secret services into Taiwan, and half of that is blocked by the Taiwan CIC. This is very delicate issue, and I haven't heard any details yet from anybody yet. So that is one thing. And also one more interesting thing is if China does interesting approach that they are doing around Senkaku and also in South China Sea, that is a kind of the initiative of the setting up new regal frame. First they declared the air Defense identification zone over Sintaku, but their Addis concept is bit different from ours. We don't say anything about the severe aircraft coming near to the Addis, but they say that might cause some difficulty. So when they declared addict more than ten years ago over Senka, that caused a lot of difficult situation for the civil aviation around that area. And also that kind of initiative was rather taken towards the Nine Dot line area. That was the very interesting first step to declare that inside of the nine dot line is their sovereign water. So this kind of legal initiative, of course, it's not acceptable to any people besides China. But still, China can say that this is the legal action from the Chinese side. Therefore, this is not the military provocation this kind. Of how can I say tactical approach not really let's say that this is I said this way Chinese can say this is not the invasion rather say this is the kind of meter this is kind of police approach for example if there comes a number know awful cases. For example in Shanghai and there came a kind of civil war inside of Shanghai and these mobs running out of Shanghai and they got shipped and then head to senkok island. And then Chinese police had them kind of hot pass through and those mobs surrounded Senkaku and then Chinese police side is following it and controlling everything over Senkaku. But they still say this is a kind of police activities against rebels, inshallah. And they can say, this is not an invasion. This is the police initiatives inside of their sovereignty. If we are going to stop it, they are going to say, don't do that. We are now managing the criminal traits. So this is a totally illogical business, but show assigned kind of say, pretension that they are doing some legal thing. So this kind of plot can easily be bandaged by somebody and that can be easily beyond our imagination of kind of military activity. So this kind of, you know, this kind of irregular approaches can be managed by the Chinese towards Taiwan and this can be very delicate issue or sensitive issue, and we better pay more attention. This kind know, derogate approaches. Chinese derogatory approaches towards Taiwan. That's what I feel now.

Speaker A:
Thank you very much thank you very much nissan let me just make a comment observation in the past couple of weeks that deals with this Air Defense Identification Zone issue. One noticeable point that I see is the number of international flights in and out of China is significantly reduced and Tokyo is being more used as a hub even by the Chinese so you see many Chinese passengers going from China into Japan. Just one point for transfer to other flights because the flights are not coming into China. So it's just something to be noteworthy of it may not be all that significant, but I think as Nissan and I and others know, it is definitely different. So, Tom Sato, just shifting to the technical side of all of this, you brought up the Arm IPO. And one other thing that several of us notice going on in China right now and outside of China is the significant advance of Huawei. And huawei and the arm. IPO do have an association. So, Tom, if you could make some comments, please.

Speaker B:
Can I show my presentation, Bill?

Speaker A:
Yes, please.

Speaker B:
Go ahead. Okay. So many, many years ago, I was working at Microsoft as a Windows Product Manager for Japan and had close working relationship with Bill Gates as my boss. And Mr. Son, who was a major force in the software distribution in Japan at that time, around about 30 years ago now. And what they have in common is that they want to create a global standard. And Bill Gates achieved that. Mr. Sony is still wanting to do that. And the Arm IPO is one of the steps he's taking. And it's quite an incredible company. This company licensed microprocessor design to chip companies like Qualcomm, Nvidia, Huawei, Apple use it. In fact, all of the smartphone uses Armchip. And some of the fastest supercomputers like Fujitsu, Sengaku, Fugaku. And Nvidia's latest chip is based on Arm. But back in 2015 and 2016, it was all about IoT, because Arm is a risk based microprocessor. It's faster, smaller, less power hungry, and great for small devices. And that meant that it was good for mobile handset as well. And so Arm became unanimous chip for small devices and IoT. And Mr. Som believed that IoT would take over the world and that there would be billions of devices around the world. And he felt that he could create a global standard in IoT computing. And that's why he bought Soap Arm for 32 billion in July 16, quite a while ago. But what happened next was quite interesting. First of all, next year he created a SoftBank Vision Fund with $100 billion from Saudis and Abu Dhabi and other investors. And he needed an anchor investment. So he sold 25% stake in Arm to SoftBank Vigilant Fund for $8 billion at the same valuation as he bought it. And then he tried to sell Arm to Nvidia because Nvidia was going places, had lots of money, and that also he liked Jensen and he thought that Arm and Nvidia would totally destroy AMD and intel. But that didn't happen because Google, Microsoft and many others said that this was rather problematic, anti competitive and so on. And the regulators just stopped the merger. And that didn't come through. But what happened was that things got improved in terms of prospect for Arm. So in order to take it public. First thing SOPA needed to do was take back that 25% from the Vision Fund, because if there was 25% at Vision Fund, they would have sold it on open market and that would create a great sell pressure to the newly minted Arm IPO stock. So SoftBank bought the Arm shares for double the money, really at $64 billion valuation for 16 billion. And this was okay for the Vision Fund because it was round about the same price as expected price of the IPO. And also the fact that previous last year, Vision Fund wrote off $32 billion worth of investment because of many of the investments that failed. So the investors want some money back, and top one wanted a stable IPO. So this is what happened. Next thing is the IPO, and I want to talk about IPO, but I want to talk about what's going to happen next, because this is really the AI story. So IPO was like a week ago, I think was floated on Nasdaq at IPO price of $51. And it went all the way up to 55, close to $55 on the opening day. At the moment, it's around about 52, $52 at $52 billion valuation. But although the price has declined to the IPO pricing level, people are very happy with the outcome. People expect that there's an initial volatility in these funds, but it didn't go below the IPO price, and initial pop gave some profit to those people who allocated the IPO shares. And SoftBank, incredibly, still hold 90% of this Arm holdings, which is worth, at current valuation, close to $50 billion. Now, that's way below what SoftBank had in terms of their investment into Alibaba. But SoftBank been selling off Alibaba for past ten years, and their stake at the moment is around about 3.7%. Not much left there. But what's going to happen next is really interesting because just recently, and I think this is what participated into getting Arm to the Nasdaq was the announcement and the release of Nvidia's Grace CPU. It's a brand new microprocessor based on the Arm architecture. And it is the most highest performing chip for servers, for data centers. It outperforms many of the AMD and intel chips, and it is one of the most incredible chip ever built, probably at below five nanometer at the TMSC. But the most incredible is this super chip, which combines the Nvidia's Hopper GPU with the Grace microprocessor, which is based on Arm, because this is the chip which is going to do all of the AI computation at a variety of data centers. And Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, everybody, including SoftBank, have been advanced in this chip to populate it into their server, into their data centers, because AI is extremely power hungry and you need something like this to really crunch the initial model building. So this has just been released, and there's no doubt that many of the Arm licensees, like Qualcomm's or Fujitsu's, or everybody else, including the Chinese, will be building something like this. I'm pretty sure Huawei is working on an Arm based super chip like this in order to create their AI data center, because this is what the Arm chip can do. And this means that not only the Arm will become the de facto AI chip of the world, but I don't think the Chinese aspect will go away anytime soon. After all, this company, Arm, is a British company controlled by Japanese company with Japanese CEO. And it doesn't fall under the jurisdiction of the United States unless United States really strong. Know Japan and UK and tell them that you have to stop selling Arm design to Chinese, which is extremely difficult because Arm and Huawei and many of the chip companies, they have been working together for past ten years and they have the design already, and they can build these chips internally. And it's extremely hard to pull it out from production in China for US. Administration. So what I think will happen is that currently it's valued at $52 billion, and Nvidia's valuation is $1 trillion. And Mason believes that the Arm could be worth as much as Nvidia. So I think the reason why Mr. Son is smiling now, despite the fact that last year he lost $32 billion for Vision Fund, is because of this huge opportunity in AI. And when I look at the AI application created by my friends in Israel and in Japan and in United States, they are extremely power hungry, they are extremely capable, and they're like twelve months away from food deployment of their AI musicians, or AI cybersecurity, or AI everything. So just like the IoT boom ten years ago, AI is going to be everywhere. It's going to be on our phone, it's going to be on our computer, it will be in our cars, washing machines or whatever. It will be everywhere. And I think for 90% or even 95% of the time, it's for the benefit of the humanity. Okay? What's worrying the administration and many people in the industry is those rogue characters are using AI to create terminator T 1000 or whatever, and using it in the very adverse situation. That is highly unlikely to happen. But I think this AI needs to be regulated such that it is always used for humanities and good for the economy and all of that. And for next ten years, Mr. Tong will be using this opportunity Arm stock to further AI investment. So that's what I think will happen. And I Think this Arm IPO was an incredible success. Thank you very much.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Tom. Just a note for everybody. Grace Hopper, I just find it interesting they named the chip after her, a very famous, ahead of her time US. Navy. Admiral Howard, if you don't mind, if I could, listening to everything that you've heard this morning and thanks for sticking with us. If you could just offer some reflection of what's going on, where we're going, and keeping in mind what Henry Kissinger said yesterday. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Sure. Well, I had heard that Kissinger has worked with Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, on a book on AI. He's been very focused in that area. Even at 100, he's sharp as attack and staying up with what's going on and understands that AI is really the future. A couple of things that I heard, Penny Pristro I happened to have talked to last week and who's an amazing woman and amazing person, really, and I think the rebuilding of Ukraine, she'll really be able to help there. I really resonated with some of the things Jerry said and with Peter's Caveats in that we're building a different kind of infrastructure today. So what used to be wires which could be cut and bombed is now wireless and it's much harder to interfere with wireless. And I urge those of you who have the time to read the Elon Musk biography. And one of the interesting things about that is that, in fact, just as Peter said, starlink has been extremely critical to the Ukrainian success, but also to controlling which parts of the war they can do. So the huge hurr occurred when Musk decided that the Ukrainians were going to attack the Russians and cut off Starlink access 100 miles from the front. And he's able to do that because he has complete control of the Starlink cluster and he can say, look, they can't access it from anywhere between 100 miles from the current battlefront into the Russian area and just turned it off. And the Ukrainians were furious. The US was furious, but they had nothing they could do. I mean, it's a private company. He had been nice enough to give them a lot of satellite communication equipment so that they get started. He then sort of asked the US government and others to pay for some of that. But it is true that the Starlink story is a key part of Ukrainian story and the Ukrainian war story and I think really critical. Another key announcement this week was Amazon putting large language model technology into the Echo system, the Alexas and Echoes and so on. So in the fall, in a couple of months, you'll be able to talk to your Amazon device. If you have one of those Echoes or Alexas, and we have about a dozen of them around the houses and offices, without saying the wake word, without saying Alexa, please do this, you'll be able to have the conversation with it the same as you would with a human and with pretty good voices. So that is going to be a true pushing of that AI, large language model technology, really, to the mass market without people having to understand how to sign up for Chat GPT or those things. And finally, the company Clarify in the US, which I'm a small investor in, which offers that face recognition technology. I did sit down at a cafe during COVID with the founder and he took a snap of me with his phone and then ran it through clarify and it came up with all of the pictures to be on the web. And of course, there's a lot of privacy issues associated with it, but the fact is that technology is out there. Pimize now makes you pay for it. It's going to be free on the Dark Web very soon. So understand that you can no longer hide if you're in England, where there's a camera every couple of meters, if you're in New York, if you're in any major city, obviously all over China, and you can't really change your face enough to defeat most of these algorithms, it's just going to find you. It's going to find every picture of you on the web, every clip of you in a video. And I was talking to a friend about one of the companies that makes the technology no longer uses badges in their offices. People just walk up to the door and just keep walking because the door opens if it recognizes your face and the recognition. The false positives are extremely low. There are well under one in 1000 and the false negatives are a little bit higher. But if you just stand there a little longer, it gets it right. So big changes there. And then I just want to say one other thing based on the readings this week, which I thought was disturbing, which was that food security being used as a weapon, weaponizing the food supplies of the world. And I thought that article was right on because with the Nugmur Karabach in Azerbaijan, Armenia, that whole area, the Russians have absolutely trying to starve them out and using the food security as a weapon. It's happening in parts of Africa as well. So it is definitely something we should be concerned about. And that's probably good for a longer discussion in a few weeks because the rules of war change over time in terms of what you can do to civilians. The Russians seem to have been violating some of those in Ukraine. But you're not supposed to starve your enemy in the way that's being done. There may be something we can talk about there, but it's been very interesting. And I will say on Arm, it's in everything you did point out. It's in the apple chips. And it was named after Admiral Hopper, who was one of the early computer science people in computers and is absolutely the person who discovered the first bug. And what she actually did was discover that physically there was an insect that was causing some of the relays to be stopped. So there was truly a bug, and she's the one who found the bug and named it the bug. So anyway, have a good week, everybody.

Speaker A:
Well, thank you. And Howard, on the note on food security, the author of that article is Yelena's husband, and he will be talking to us in the next couple of weeks on the Saturday Call. So obviously through the notes it'll relay to him, but I'm sure he'll appreciate the comments. You just made one last note because it's just come out on the press. I mentioned the Asian Games are going on opening this evening. The Prime Minister of South Korea is attending the Asian Games, and it's just announced over the press that Xi Jinping will make a visit to South Korea. I mean, these sort of things change a lot and all have to be factored in. But what an amazing discussion we've all just had. Lot to think about. Thank you very much, everybody. Have a great week and we'll see you soon. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Bye.
