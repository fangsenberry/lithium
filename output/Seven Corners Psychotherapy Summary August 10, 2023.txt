- Japanese Prime Minister’s statements regarding Taiwan-China relations are seen as misleading.
- An informal discussion occurred between several speakers discussing Taiwan's politics and potential future scenarios.
- The anticipation is that the current vice president of Taiwan might run for presidency, possibly triggering forceful actions from China to prevent Taiwan's independence.
- However, if a KMT candidate wins the presidency, a more diplomatic approach may be chosen.
- The Chinese government invited former Taiwanese President Ma – an unprecedented move, signifying its strategy to keep multiple options open.
- Xi Jinping's (China's current leader) primary goal is to ensure the Communist Party's long-term rule. Using force is not his only or preferred strategy, contrary to what some US 'China hawks' believe.
- Views diverge on whether Xi Jinping has set a deadline to decide if he would be using force. Some believe it to be by 2027, while others argue it's more focused on 2032.
- Taiwan’s energy policy may have significant geopolitical impact as it aims to retire existing nuclear power plants by 2025; this planned dependency on Liquid Natural Gas (LNG) could expose Taiwan to additional vulnerabilities, particularly to blockades.
- By 2025, Taiwan would only have a month-long LNG supply for residential use in case of a blockade, making Taiwan more vulnerable to Chinese pressure without active warfare.
- The United States, Japan, and South Korea could potentially cooperate in joint energy production to reduce cost and dependency on specific energy sources.
- However, a proposed joint venture between Japan and Korea for development of the continental shelf west of Kyushu for Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) could be politically challenging due to historical issues.
- Uncertainties in the global context around Panama Canal and the impact of environmental factors, such as El Nino, affecting its ability to handle larger units complicates the practicality of such cooperative ventures in the energy sector.- There was discussion about surging LNG and hydrogen through the Panama Canal.
- Concerns were raised about potential deflation in China due to manufacturing problems and market issues.
- It was mentioned that China recently recorded negative inflation post-COVID-19.
- It was suggested China would not experience a decade-long deflation like Japan, largely due to faster intervention and capital injections into the banking system.
- However, unemployment among young college graduates is high, posing potential pressure on the Chinese Communist Party.
- It was suggested that China may invest in state-owned companies to alleviate this.
- Three issues were highlighted within the Chinese economy: overinvestment in real estate, abnormal high youth unemployment, and failure of Xi Jinping’s economic policies.
- These policies have included interventionist actions such as stopping the IPO of the Ant Group and intervening in the IT sector through competition policy.
- The concept of common prosperity instituted by Mao Zedong was reportedly being reintroduced by Xi Jinping.
- Greater social instability is predicted due to economic decline in China, and this is coupled with an ineffective government under Xi Jinping and widespread anxiety.
- The sudden disappearance of the Foreign Minister and purges in military leadership were highlighted as signs of internal party instability.
- It was implied that social discourse in China is heavily monitored and reduced to non-sensitive issues like pork prices.
- It was noted that there were moves within China to rewrite the history of the fight against Japanese imperialism in relation to Taiwan.
- The conversation then touched on the ongoing conflict in Ukraine with Russia, with the West reportedly trying to reduce Russia’s occupation of 20% of Ukrainian territory.
- There is reportedly no motivation on any side to start negotiations for peace.
- The conversation touched briefly on political change in Africa, including aggressive moves by Russia.
- Kitamurisan noted Japan's agreement with several African countries to procure rare metals.
- A discussion on AI revealed skepticism over its hyped potential, and commentary on past attempts at AI use within the NSA and a now-defunct project called Psych.
- It was noted that while AI does improve productivity in the manufacturing sector, its impact in the service sector remains uncertain.
- The group closed the discussion with the mention of concerns over AI and superconnectivity in the future.- The use of AI tools in the financial sector is recognized but there is hesitance in relying on these tools for fundamental investment decisions.
- Speaker E prepared remarks on economic security and the revision of the anti-spine law in China, but will discuss this further next time.
- Speaker E regrets not being able to participate more actively this time.
- Speaker F found the discussion useful, particularly appreciating Professor Matsuda's views on the situation in Taiwan.
- Speaker F acknowledges the numerous input from Terra Zarathan on the energy challenges anticipated in 2025 and the discussions held.
- There was participation from both Asian and non-Asian members; future participation is also anticipated with eagerness. 
- Speaker C and Speaker B ended the meeting with appreciations to all participants.
