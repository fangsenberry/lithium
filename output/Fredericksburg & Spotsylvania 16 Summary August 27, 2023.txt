- A system is being developed to allow foreign workers to work in Japan, including passing an examination for a work visa permit.
- Agencies are collaborating with Kanazawa University to make education for these workers feasible.
- Opportunities for scholarship and housing are available, intended for those who want to advance their skills for the local economy.
- The potential for expansion to recruit workers from other countries, such as India is acknowledged, despite higher costs associated with workers from India.
- Additionally, a comparison is made highlighting that workers from Sri Lanka could be a cheaper source of labor while providing intellectual input.
- This approach is presented as a potential solution to combat the decline of Japan's population, with a projection over 30 years.
- Speakers also discuss historical and recent diplomatic relations and tensions between several countries, including India, China, Korea, and Japan.
- There is speculation about the potential for a detente between China and India.
- The potential of a reunified Korea, akin to East and West Germany, being nuclear-armed is highlighted as a concern. 
- The conversation touches on cultural and language shifts in Asia, specifically discussing Chinese characters' use in Korea and the changes therein.
- The talk also covers personal experiences and sentiments regarding travels and global weather phenomena.
- Executive Order on technology investment discussed, clarifying it's not a reverse CFIUS or an outbound investment screening program, but a restriction and reporting program, issued by President Biden along with an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking by the Treasury Department.- This Executive Order has structure similarities to the treasury sanctions programs, making it seem more intense.
- The Treasury Department targets three areas of technology - AI, Quantum and Semiconductors, but the treasury is not contemplating doing restrictions on investment.
- The order calls for reporting on investments as opposed to restricting them particularly in AI and a large section of the semiconductor industry.
- The program is in its early stages, with recent bipartisan letters encouraging Congress to make it more robust.
- Some hope for stricter regulations, while others like Secretary Yellen appears less enthusiastic about the idea, influencing the program to align more closely to what she wants as possible.
- The degree of restriction and restrain fluctuates among Republicans, with some wanting a tougher version of the program while others deem it excessive.
- The order focuses more on using terms common in an export control, raising questions on how these terms will be crafted for easy understanding and application for private equity funds.
- The scope of what has a reporting requirement against what has a restriction within AI, quantum and semiconductors is yet to be defined by the Treasury.
- Not all investments will be restricted, and the order won't apply retrospectively. Treasury is proposing to exempt public market and some private market investments.
- The key question on the outbound investment program definition, such as foreign, remains, and the Treasury contemplates a threshold where a firm not mostly engaged in covered activity but has a subsidiary that is would not be covered.
- The Executive order explicitly focuses on China, raising questions on the perceived targeting of China by the U.S and the possible impacts.
- Though the order is China-focused, it's about companies that could be under the control of China, and this will require companies' diligence if the order progresses as it is.
- There's debate about whether outbound investment is the right path, sparking the question of the kind of system we will live in 5 to 10 years.
- Concerns over Chinese intervention in the economy are escalating and shaping immediate and long-term impacts of market decisions, leading to discussions on the course of future strategies.
- The executive order will be one of the topic of discussions when Secretary Raymond meets her Chinese counterparts in Beijing, raising speculations on the Chinese response. It's predicted to align more with the moderate voices in the Biden Administration.
- The anticipation and proposed rulemaking contemplate criminal violations for executive order violations, and there is a provision for referring potential criminal violations to the Attorney general, a structure more analogous to a traditional sanctions program.- The speaker questioned the necessity of a national emergency declaration and wondered if it was linked to either a technology export restriction or a capital control restriction.
- This is important to understand because Europe often follows US action.
- Most sanctions programs enacted through an executive order are based on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEPA). Using this act, the President can declare a national emergency, enabling the creation of a sanctions program.
- The European Commission is expected to publish its proposal for an outbound investment program by the end of the year, and Germany is also assessing an outbound investment program.
- The Biden administration has expressed interest in G7 partners, including Japan, introducing similar programs.
- The US government's concern is that certain investments carry non-monetary benefits such as expertise sharing and reputation boost. However, some parties view it as more of a capital control.
- The program described is considered a capital control, despite being pitched as targeting ‘smart capital’.
- The scope and conditions of the capital control will be determined over time.
- The process for implementing this capital control is expected to be lengthy.
- Early stage capital investments are treated differently than liquid market investments into China.
- The New Development Bank (formerly BRICS bank) has new leadership but has been criticized for a lack of a digital strategy.
- Questions remain about prioritization of resources in the bank, and how it will be capitalized.
- The BRICS group includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, and has new members, including the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Argentina, Senegal, Bangladesh, and Ethiopia.
- The bank's policies and capitalization will be significant in shaping its future.
- Argentina has been suggested to join the BRICS group, but the country is currently facing economic difficulties with massive dollarization. Largest Brazilian bank, Ita, recently exited Argentina, selling its operations to a local bank.
- Political processes and elections in Latin America, like in Ecuador, continue to be marred by violence and crime, further complicating the region's stability.- El Salvador currently has over 1% of its population in jail, signaling potential issues with its institutional effectiveness.
- Ecuador recently ran a national poll, where its citizens voted against developing oil fields in the Amazon, making it the first country in the region to ban oil exploration in the Amazon.
- Countries in the region are aiming to capitalize more on their natural resources and this can be seen as a function of evolving technologies and business models.
- Brazil, accounting for 50% of South America's population and GDP, is planning to develop an ecological transition program that covers two to three decades and includes a range of initiatives like creating a carbon market and supporting the development of clean-tech industries.
- Brazilian investors will be discussing climate investment and transitions during the UN Assembly in September. 
- Despite not being the president, the speaker suggests the creation of a joint Brazil-European Union fund to drive green hydrogen clean energy.
- Countries in the BRICS group, such as India and China, have capabilities that others do not. For instance, India recently landed a rover on the moon using a cost-effective space program.
- Challenges faced by countries in Latin America, such as the need for institutional reforms, were also highlighted.
- The Brazilian Congress, when combined with the Senate, has the second-largest budget in the world after the US Congress. The size of its economy in relation to GDP underscores the challenges Brazil faces in modernizing the public sector and building a competitive economy.
- A variety of changes in the global supply chain were observed. For the US, reliance on China has reduced with imports now largely coming from Mexico and surrounding countries. However, these countries still depend on China for their supply chains.
- Due to the changes brought on by the recent executive order on decoupling, it's believed that investments in China will reduce and that the country will need to refocus on internal consumption.
- The discussion also moved to the G7 and BRICS groups, noting that there are currently no Muslim countries in either group. However, several Muslim countries, such as Iran, Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia, are keen to join. They also noted the admission of Argentina to the BRICS group and the impact this could have on the group's dynamics.
  
(Note: In this summary, speech turns have been merged for coherence, but the text has preserved the speakers' original language as faithfully as possible.)- Local energy transactions have been implemented in ASEAN to prevent the US from controlling and sanctioning them.
- This move has reduced dependence on the US dollar and increased the volume of transactions conducted in local currencies.
- The local currency transaction (LCT) may impact executive orders and could contribute to digitalization, specifically peer-to-peer digital transactions.
- The use of Central Bank digital currency (CBDC) may make it difficult for external parties to track transactions.
- CBDC, likened to cryptocurrency but not the same, can enable peer-to-peer transactions that can occur on-chain but are managed by individual countries.
- Transactions made digitally and using the CBDC would be hard for outsiders to trace.
- The BRICS LCT system could potentially rival bodies such as the United Nations due to its increasing influence.
- There's acceleration into the digital space in ASEAN with a digital minister for every country now.
- Alongside this digital progress, artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a significant player, though its safety remains a point of contention.
- Over the next decade, an anticipated decline in the use of the US dollar is expected.
- The history of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) begins with the proposal by Goldman Sachs' Chief Economist, Jim O'Neill, in 2001, and the first summit took place in 2009. South Africa joined in 2010.
- An enlargement occurred 13 years later, with six more countries joining. Over 40 countries have expressed interest in joining, with 23 countries submitting formal application documents.
- BRICS is seen as representative of the Global South and is popular because of its possible financial support and development opportunities.
- Financial support from BRICS Bank is sought-after, and members are keen on the right to develop regardless of US-China competition or geopolitical issues. The BRICS spirit is seen as helpful to these nations.
- The release of Japan's nuclear-contaminated water into the ocean has caused concerns for China, and the matter is related to loss of political trust in the region.
- With regards to the expansion of BRICS and the adoption of central bank digital currencies, these trends could change how cross-border trade and finance take place and provoke global discussions on rules that should govern such transactions.
- There's hope that such debates could lead to increased efficiency and healthy competition in the global economy.
