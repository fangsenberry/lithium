Speaker A:
In both negative and positive way. The negative report is that Japanese Prime Minister urged Taiwanese to fight against China. Report is that saying that Japan will also fight together? Both are quite misleading.

Speaker B:
Nissan, how are you?

Speaker C:
Evening, Nishan.

Speaker D:
I'm okay, thank you.

Speaker E:
Very good.

Speaker B:
You are the only one from the Japanese side who's wearing a jacket and a tie.

Speaker F:
Think I will shut the bag.

Speaker C:
He just got back from Australia, so he's still in an Australian friend of mine.

Speaker E:
I'm the youngest pastor here, so I should respect all people. But now everybody.

Speaker F:
Morning.

Speaker C:
Good morning, Admiral. How are you?

Speaker F:
Barely made it, but I'm here. Computer is acting up. Good morning.

Speaker C:
All good morning. Good evening.

Speaker E:
Good morning.

Speaker C:
We have everybody filled, everybody from the Japanese side. And I think it's going to be you and I, maybe Joe Smelze timing. And so we're more informal today, but I suggested to Kita Morris on that maybe we might start off, Admiral, with you just review your sessions at the Grove a little bit, if that's okay.

Speaker F:
Over to it, please.

Speaker C:
No, if you could start, admiral, please.

Speaker F:
Want me to start? Okay. So much going on internationally and domestically here at home. So it's a more confused world than usual. But I'm focused on critical issue. Where does she want to lead? And in that context, what are his plans for Taiwan here? I'm a little bit of a heretic, maybe. I think he's on a dual track that on one side preparing the military if he decides to use force.

Speaker D:
On.

Speaker F:
The other side, greasing the wheels for a diplomatic push. All of it depends on the outcome of the January election in Taiwan. If the current vice president wins the presidency, I think Chinese are persuaded that he will move for independence, and therefore they will have to use force, prevent it. On the other hand, if the KMT candidate wins the presidency, then a repetition of the 208 to 16 time frame will offer a different path. And what started me down this crooked path was the invitation for former President Ma to visit China. There's no past precedent for that at all. It clearly had to fit in some longer term strategic vision by she of keeping open the various options for dealing. So with that wandering start, let me hand the podium over to.

Speaker E:
I believe your analysis is so correct. I think what is most important for the Taiwanese politics, it's an election of the next year. Despite my political tendency, it's my guess, I think the Kemp president will stabilize the situation of the Tiger Strait. It's a rather midstown guess, but in reality, the situation will going forward. Like I said. Thank you.

Speaker C:
Matsuda sensei, would you like to continue on that?

Speaker B:
Me?

Speaker C:
No matsuda sensei.

Speaker E:
Matsuda sensei?

Speaker C:
Yes.

Speaker A:
Okay.

Speaker C:
Admiral Matsuda, Professor Matsuda is in Taiwan now.

Speaker F:
Please.

Speaker A:
I'm closely watching the situation, both domestic and prostrate and international situation over Taiwanese. Well so far the most hopeful candidate is the Vice president, Lai the second hopeful candidate is the third party, the Taiwan people. So actually the knee candidate is really in a bad situation actually, not only me, almost all the people in Taiwan think that this time KMT not hopeful we have to be prepared for the continuation of BBC government. I think that percentage is the highest. The co enter has no actual staff he's kind of a populist he's very popular in young voter but he doesn't have he doesn't have legislatures, just a few legislatures only so if he is elected that he has to make a kind of coalition government with KMT KMT is going to try to gain power again four years later. So this coalition government will be very fragile and the DPP will fight against the coalition government so if current gets elected, the situation will be very vulnerable and unstable maybe if the DPP candidate is elected, I think that we can foresee the future direction and basically continuity and stability goes on. The current situation is this and the KMT is in turmoil they decided the candidate but actually there are two more challenges inside the inside and outside of the box I don't think that can be hopeful this time so far this is my kind of observation about situation and also one more thing china is very carefully watching the situation and trying not to intervene that much because usually China's intervention on Taiwan's election will work negatively that will make a backlash so Xi Jinpin has learned a lot from experience four years ago he is now very careful about dealing with so far so stable situation.

Speaker F:
One of the things that may be working for KMT or coalition is the substantial tradition now after eight years exhaustion and wanting to change parties and we've seen that play a role in 2008 began in 2016 see if that still assisted factor in 24 what we do know with Turkey is the Chinese will be very active inside Taiwan and with all the outside pressures to try to produce the outcome they.

Speaker E:
Would like to see.

Speaker F:
Over to you, Kitamura san.

Speaker E:
I pose a question to the professor I mentioned about despite my political tendency you predict the continuity of the regime DPP but in the long term what's the perception of the Xi Jinping for so long time the regime of the DPP? Maybe it's possible he can choose another option against the Taiwan regime what do you think about that?

Speaker A:
In my observation, useful force is not the only because Xi Jinpin's ultimate goal is to maintain an eternal government of the Communist Party. And if he thinks that there is only one way to unify with Taiwan, that is the only way to maintain Communist Party rule over China. He may use force, but if he thinks that there are another ways to maintain the Communist rule, or if he loses the force, the Communist Party will definitely lose. The power, then he won't use force. The threat by force has been always from China against Taiwan. But use of force and preparation of use of force and the threat by force are totally different notion yet to use.

Speaker D:
Force.

Speaker A:
He has made an order to prepare for the use of force. But it does not necessarily mean that he has already made a decision.

Speaker E:
I can understand very well what you said, but the continuity of the DPP regime is not favorable for the ultimate purpose of the Xi jinping for the education of the Taiwan. Therefore, if in case of the regime of the continuity of the regime of the TPP what option of the Xi jinping will take for the middle term or the long term reeducation of the Taiwan?

Speaker A:
It also depends on the result of the election. The result of the election is because there are three major candidates. At least three major candidates. So the winner cannot gain majority because there is no majority vote. There is. Only one chance relative majority winner can get elected. So if Light gains only 40% voters, then China can say that, oh, 60% of the people are opposing independent compliance. It's a kind of deceiving themselves self brainwashing or something. Like that but it has been done for many, many decades in China secondly, the legislative UN the parliament may be in a very difficult position the ruling party cannot gain the majority in that case there is a very big power in the opposition side. In that situation too, China can say that the pro independence DPP has lost the majority of the people's support. So that the DPP cannot go for independence. So it depends on the result. And the Lichen cannot gain vast majority such as what gained four years ago. It's impossible because there are multiple more than three candidates. In that case, China can enhance communications and exchanges with the Taiwanese people opposition KMT and they try to bribe them and try to control that's choice what CGP is likely to take.

Speaker E:
Based on your analysis despite the result of the presidential election, the influential operation by PRC will continue to make some targets of the internal politics of Taiwan?

Speaker A:
I think so because basically now we are in the post Pandemic era and China has already lift the regulations of Taiwanese people's entry to the country. So there are a lot of thousands of local leaders have been already invited to the mainland China and they are having very good time in the mainland China, mostly being bribed. So the huge scale of exchanges are going on. So the use of force is not the choice of order to the head of the Taiwan Affairs Office in the State Council, Mr. Song Tao, to promote huge scale of exchanges this year and it is going on. So I think that China is not a simple country to go for china has many choices so I think that the population will be further going on.

Speaker E:
Thank you very much for your insightful analysis. In anyhow, the Vice President Lie is the most hopeful candidate to the Taiwanese people. At the same time, Xi Jinping is thinking that the use of the force is the ultimate last choice for that solution. In such case, I think actual status quo will continue for a while even after the presidential election.

Speaker F:
We're hearing I'm sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker A:
Yeah. It also depends on what kind of messages will be released from Taiwan. Basically, the ruling BPP is now very low key on its independence related agenda. Like Inter has already said that we don't need to declare independence. Already independent name is republic of China. Taiwan. So this kind of electoral politics when election is coming, the DPP candidates become very low key on its political agenda. I think that this will be repeated.

Speaker F:
What we're hearing from the China hawks in the US. Is their belief that she has decided to use force and that he will do that by 2027. And the only logic I can find for that argument is that's when this five year term would end. But I don't think she sees his reign ending in 2027. I think he's more focused on 2032, a ten year run here rather than so I don't see this point. The internal pressures that say he has to choose which track he's going to follow in the near term. So much will happen with the election. Yes, I yield it.

Speaker C:
Terra Zalasan, please.

Speaker B:
My perspective for energy, 2025, very tipping point for Thailand energy situation is that Thailand policy is to abolish retire all the existing power plants by 2025.

Speaker A:
I think that there is a big noise always going around.

Speaker B:
Can other people mute their microphones?

Speaker F:
I hear it also.

Speaker C:
I'll mute everybody except the speakers.

Speaker B:
Okay. I was trying to get from the energy perspective, 2025 will be a very important year. Taiwan's policy is to retire the existing nuclear power plants by 2025. And I believe they will be retiring the remaining coal fired power plants, most of them, by 2025. And their policy is to basically depend upon LNG for their power generation. And I asked the speaker spokesperson for Vice President Rai about the sustainability of the supply of LNG because as you know, it is hard to store LNG. His response was that usually Taiwan would only have two weeks left to run the LNG if there was a blockade. And I asked in a situation of blockade, what would Taiwan do? And his response was that the Taiwanese government will force the industry to stop using electricity and concentrate on the supply of power for the people. And I asked them how much time. I asked him how much time will last if they would be only providing power to the people. And he said one month. So there is a wide range for the use of force. But after 2025, a blockade shutting off the LNG supply would put Taiwan at a full sort of out of order in four weeks. So it will be difficult now because they still have nuclear and coal, but after 25, Taiwan will be very vulnerable for potential blockades. So that's something I worry about the Taiwanese energy policy, which will give at least much more room for Xi Jinping to play this blockade room short of actual use of force.

Speaker C:
Terra Zawassan, if you wouldn't mind looking at ahead next week of the US japan ROK Summit from the energy perspective and South Korea, could you give a similar piece of thinking, please? Thank you.

Speaker B:
My expectation for the trilateral leaders meeting.

Speaker C:
Well, especially because of energy in South Korea and their vulnerabilities as well.

Speaker B:
I have no inside information about the tri level leaders meeting, but the vulnerability that we have and South Korea has is basically similar in terms of energy vulnerability. So there is a room for commonality or potential cooperation among the three countries. And I see theoretically that Korea and Japan would have to depend upon imported hydrogen or ammonia. And one of the great source could be from Texas, from the US to supply hydrogen and ammonia. And by having Japan and Korea working together, we can realize the scale to get the cost lower. Looking back at the history of LNG, japan was the only importer of LNG for a decade or so. So we had to keep on paying a high price for LNG. After a decade or so, South Korea joined and then followed by Taiwan, and then the cost went down. So maybe we can do it faster together by having this trial ethical operation the US, Japan, South Korea in the joint supply of hydrogen and ammonia. I think this will be a very positive agenda which probably no one would oppose. So I think this would be one deliverable. The second aspect of potential idea which came across to me from someone is that in 1978, japan and Korea agreed upon a joint development of the continental shelf west of Kyushu. And I understand there are some US players who want to develop that area, not for oil or gas, but a potential location for CCS. CCS is carbon capture and storage. The sea zone is shallow, so theoretically it could be a good location for CCS. So I'm not surprised that some of the US. Players may want to see that area to be usable for the development. But historically, I think this is something probably externrasa knows much better is that this Japan Korea agreement was made in 1978 and the area is within the middle line between Japan and Korea. So at the time, in 1978, there was strong criticism in Japan that we are giving in too much to the Koreans at the time because the development was not beyond the middle line, it was within the inside of the Japanese side of the middle line. So I think there might be someone from the US side who may consider this may be a good proposal for Korea, Japan and maybe the US energy companies to work together. But it will be very potentially politically difficult, especially from the Japanese more conservative side who believes that the 1978 agreement was giving it too much to South Korea at the time. And so this is something that it may come across you, but I think if there are choice between those two, go ahead with a joint development of hydrogen and ammonia, not for that joint development zone which will be politically very explosive.

Speaker F:
There is an additional complication from the US side brought about by El Nino and the rest and that's the shortage of water in Panama, which is affecting the Panama Canal, its ability to handle the larger units. So when we had the need to surge LNG to Europe, there was no impediment, but surging LNG and hydrogen, it's got to go through the Panama Canal. We may have an additional problem.

Speaker B:
I didn't think about that, but that's a serious problem.

Speaker F:
Can we look to internal China for a few minutes? Principal question I have going back to Japanese experience in the late 80s through the 90s with deflation, looking at the signs that China is having substantial problems getting its manufacturing floor back in full operation and finding markets. So is there a significant possibility of deflation in China? And what's the impact of that on politics, on where China goes, the inability to continue to expand the middle class at all jobs for college students? That whole image now pass over for your views, please.

Speaker B:
Well, probably with my background I have to answer without the time to think about the answer. But I think I read in today's evening newspaper that China recorded a negative inflation in the most recent month, which is quite surprising for China Post COVID-19. To record a negative inflation deflation. So I think we are seeing signs that the economic machine of China is in trouble. Having said so, would China go through that same experience of Japan after the burst of the bubble? That I doubt, because in the early 1990s japan's economic growth was much slower, matured already compared with China as of today. And number two, the reason why we had a prolonged lost decade was that the government could not make the decision to inject capital into the financial sector that prolonged the situation. I think China, having learned the lesson from Japan and the Lehman shock, would not hesitate to inject capital into the banking system. So that while we see problems in the Chinese economic machine, I think they would have the capability to at least band Aid the situation in a quick manner. So yes, slow down, but I don't think it will be a sort of decade long kind of deflation, but it will have a much more maturing or slowing down of their economy. And what does it mean for this society. We already know the unemployment rate for the young people, especially the young college graduates, are very high. And in any country, revolution is triggered by young intellectuals without. And so I think these young people getting out from colleges in China not having jobs would pose a potential pressure for the Chinese Communist Party. So I don't know what they would do, but I think they would have to intervene and try to create jobs, especially for those young college graduates. They still have the money to do so and probably they will pump money into the state owned companies, not the private sector companies, to ensure that they would have employment. It may not be good for the long term, but probably that's what they will be doing in the short term to reduce the pressure on the government. That's what I see as I seem raising his hand. So I will hand over to.

Speaker C:
Marsan. You're on mute.

Speaker E:
I'm not the specialist of the Chinese economy neither, but I like to point out three issues. One is over investment to the real estate sectors. Actually, the lots of enterprise on this sector is two entities and at the same time it gives a very negative impact over the Chinese economy. It's the first point. Second point is as Mr. Terra Sarah raised the high rate of the unemployment of youth, it's not normal situation of the economy because if the economy is going very well, the demand of the employment is so strong, but this situation is not so normal. Third point. It's the most important point, I think the failure of the economic policy of the Xi Jinping. It started from maybe several years ago. He insisted on the common prosperity for the economy. It's the introduction of the ideology of the Malto tongue during the revolution era. Because among agriculture he started his revolution. But the time is going, the contradictory situation has enlarged. In the suburb and especially agricultural situation, the difference of the riches and poverty has increased. It's a real contradictory situation to the Mao. Therefore, he distributed the dishes of the farmer to the other peasant. That's the reality of the common prosperity insisted by Mao. Xi Jinping introduced this principle to the economy. For example, he stopped the IPO of the ant group. It's another big shock to the Chinese economy. At the same time, his government intervened the it sector through the competition policy. Such kind of the interventionist policy is not good for the economy itself. If the Xi Jinping does not change such kind of interventionist policy, the economy of China will not recover very well. It's my viewpoint.

Speaker C:
Please, Admiral. Go ahead.

Speaker F:
Phil and I went to the Central Party School for the first time in July 2012. They were at great length to make two major points. The first was their view that the US. Was in permanent decline and they were in permanent growth status and that they would pass us by as the largest economy certainly by 2030, maybe earlier in the process. And the second was that they had carefully studied the collapse of the Soviet Union, fundamental mistake by Gorbachev of reducing the role and authority of the Communist Party. And they were going exactly in the opposite direction and they would strengthen the party and its role across the entire society. And we've seen that unfold over the eleven years since then. But my sense had been that key to accepting that communist party growth intrusion in every element of society was prosperity. And the number of people who had been brought into the middle class they now owned an apartment, maybe had rental units, owned a car, were enjoying travel luxuries. And as long as that process of enhanced good middle class life was there, they were perfectly content to accept the expanding party role and not object. Now, if that view is accurate and I now look at these signs potential deflation, student unrest, houses paid for but not finished are we seeing the potential for growing dissatisfaction with the party and its control of every element of the society reaction?

Speaker C:
Matsuda sensei, please. Matsura sensei.

Speaker A:
Thank you. I think that the Chinese society has experienced COVID period and especially the zero COVID policy which was quite an extreme policies including serious lockdown and the control of all individuals move 24 hours a day and I think that this kind of excessive control is hated by the people. I could witness the people who have visited Japan in the past three years from China that they were all complaining about excessive control by the party but they cannot say so in public, especially in China they always say those complaints outside of China and also they feel fear. There is a growing sense of insecurity both individual and also as a state they feel uncertainty and insecurity of their own lives and that's also true in the economic sector. So not only the foreign investors, including Taiwanese investors in China, chinese capital also tried to leave from China because there is a huge uncertainty in the investment environment. So I think that this is big concern and growing concern in China and there are some more thing to say the newly established government under the Xi Jinping State Council is not filled by the well experienced people. Premier Li Qian has not experienced vice Premier so he is the very first time this is the very first time for him to run the central government. Usually it takes three or four months to get accustomed but this time it may take one year or so because he is not experienced and his vice Premiers also not that well experienced. So the whole government is a kind of amateur situation it takes time for them to adjust the economic difficulties so this situation is viewed by the investors. So I think that both economy and also the society think that the current situation is very unstable layer on top.

Speaker F:
Of that the sudden disappearance of the Foreign Minister and then the most recent last week, the purge of the leadership of the rocket forces what are we seeing here?

Speaker C:
Nishan, please. Nishi san.

Speaker F:
Yes?

Speaker D:
There are many interesting things, I'm afraid. The sudden disappearance of the Foreign Minister, together with the disappearance of important members of the military side things are not stable. In other words, what going on? Inside of the Communist Party is what we see now is the crash of the Youth Communist Party which basically designed and organized by Xiaopin but Dun Xiaopin was the eternal enemy of Xi Jinping's father so she hates the young YUSU Communist Party group maybe from his personal experiences another important factor inside of the party was the Zhangzhe Min's Shanghai group shanghai is basically the origin of the Chinese capitalism but that group is also smashed by Xi jinping so there is no clear entity continuing last 30 40 years and the Communist party in other words, there is only one group Xi Jinping's group but that is emerging only last ten years therefore very difficult to say how far the power and the influence of the Xi Japan's Group is spreading inside of the Communist Party. So that is something the unstable factor of the politics. That is one anxiety that I have. Another thing is the economy. Yes, Terra, Salasan and Mathurasan mentioned maybe the Chinese economy is almost following what we have done last 30 years. An awful situation. But the remarkable difference is the Japanese side. Though economically it was quite depressing. But the Japanese social stability was way enhanced by a series of natural disasters, starting from the first, the great earthquake in Hanshin in 1995 and the final one is 2011 in Pohoku. In all cases, Emperor was in the front line and appealed to the public that you people stay calm, we can manage it. But there is no such a personality or no such political factor in the Chinese politics. Therefore economic decline is going to be very serious and I wonder if there is anything, well, in a sense a remedy for this economic backlash. If there is something new as we experience through the Emperor's influence, yes, there will be a new development in the society. However, if there is none in the Chinese society while the economic damage is going to be more serious to their society than Japan suffered. The third one very personal experience, but I still keep some contact with the veterans who worked for the abandoned chemical weapon businesses in China and one of them is more than 80 specialists of chemical weapons. And he recently sent me a message through our common friends that people are getting more and more quiet because anxious about their watched by the central, watched by the power and all what people now talking is about the price of pork, nothing else. Even the matter of the inflation is a sensitive topic. That's what he implied to me. Social instability is always the difficult factor in the Chinese society and I'm afraid there is an emerging sign of the social instability through my friend's comment of this. One more interesting thing is which is not related to the Chinese economic issues but my friend recently went to China and came back quite recently and told me related to their initiative of unifying Taiwan. The important subject is how they are going to revise the history of fight against imperial Japan from 1939 to 1945. Communist Party's history mentioned repeatedly that the Communist Party fought bribery against Chinese imperials. But that is not true and even Communist Party side are very much aware of it. And if they are going to unite Taiwan in an effective and stable way they have to make a kind of amendment of the historical study which means that Kuamintan was in the front line of the fight against Japanese imperialism. This is going to be a very important challenge and the Communist Party has not worked out any good answer yet to this question. They understand the necessity but there isn't any answer yet. That is because the communication with Taiwan is now lost and therefore no chance to work out, to compromise. That is very surprising message from my friend in China because Chinese side is now so serious about the unity and integration with Taiwan itself. It's not really the matter of the power, it's not really a matter of the military but more, say deep rooted social events and that is really astonishing issue to me. Well, that's what I can say now. Thank you very much.

Speaker F:
Welcome to the meeting. Have you been listening to the meeting?

Speaker B:
Can you hear me?

Speaker C:
We can hear you, Joe. Joe's out in California. So it's a bit early. Earlier than you even.

Speaker D:
Something about my computer time setting with.

Speaker F:
Daylight savings time or something was I.

Speaker D:
Thought I was 20 minutes early. Apparently not.

Speaker F:
I apologize if I may, please take us for we have just a few minutes left to the Ukraine. The meetings in Saudi Arabia which apparently were sufficiently positive to now schedule a third meeting. Russia didn't come. But I look at that and trying to come up with terms of solutions for trying to bring the war to an end to the issue. The question I have of how long we can hold together what's been an impressive cohesion of European Union, NATO, G Seven handstream. You can hear the rhetoric in the US political campaign going of those who would reduce if not eliminate the level of U. S. Support for Ukraine. I don't think that's yet more than a brush fire but in the current climate it could grow into a bigger fire fairly fast. Trump's not been he's so busy with all his indictments that he's not spent much time on the Ukraine status. But how you all see this, how you see it playing I'd be grateful to hear any volunteers. You're still mute, I think.

Speaker E:
Yeah. Thank you. The total retaliation by Ukraine has started in June. Maybe from the viewpoint of the western side, they'd like to change the actual situation occupied 20% of the territory of the Ukraine will be decreased through such kind of the retariation, military retariation, but it was not successful. That's the most serious point on after situation, I think both the western side, Ukraine side and Russian side, there's no motivation to start the troops or start the negotiation for the war. That's the point, actually. For example, National Security Advisor Jake Saliva insisted the support of the United States will continue. But based on his remarks, I can find out the concrete purpose of the police. I think.

Speaker F:
Other topics we should try to cover in the limited time we have left.

Speaker C:
Well, one, Keita Morrison, you and I had a discussion when you were here in Washington about Africa and security in Africa and this sort of thing. Clearly, there is significant challenges in Africa right now. I just thought Kitamurisan, if you could make some comment about that.

Speaker E:
I think there are political change and some aggressive movement by Russia. But on the other hand, concerning Will procure the rare metal and rare metal there, our government started some agreement with some African countries. Just momentum given by your side, I think. Thank you.

Speaker C:
And Admiral, in the closing minutes, if you don't mind putting you on the spot because of your trusteeship at Caltech, could you make some comment about AI and superconnectivity and the issues going ahead?

Speaker F:
The hype about AI substantially exceeds the reality of where we are at this point and ignores 50 years of experience using AI. During my time as the director of NSA, 77 to 81, we made substantial use when we were leaving things behind to listen for listening, for keywords to turn on and record and then to cut off. So we didn't use all of the capacity on the first six weeks that something was left behind when we started. MCC AI was one of its seven programs, and it was divided into two parts. One, creating the tools to create the algorithms, and the second create the largest database was called Psych, successfully built by Doug Lenath, who came from Stanford, spent ten years building it, but what was finished there was no commercial value found for it. 20 years later, Morgan Stanley is using it to track compliance with their rules internally in the process. So I look at all of the speculation of Generative AI and all the rest of it, and I've come back. Fundamentally, where is the commercial value that's going to produce income that will sustain for a long time? What's happening? We clearly see it's going to have a significant impact on improving productivity in the manufacturing sector, and maybe it'll have a bigger impact than the service sector than I see. But in things like the financial sector, my sense is while the tools may be useful, that we are a long way from being willing to turn over to the machines making fundamental decisions on investment. Stop response disagreement.

Speaker C:
Kita Morrison any closing remark from you?

Speaker E:
Thank you very much and this time I prepared a little remarks about the advancement of the economic security and actualization of China related to the revision of the anti spine law. But maybe this point will be discussed next time. Thank you very much. And I'm a little bit it's regrettable for me to participate sufficiently this time. Thank you very much.

Speaker F:
Thank you. I found it useful, as always, particularly hearing Professor Matsuda's views of what's going on inside Taiwan. So we have a lot of them clearly from Terra Zarathan on energy challenges looming in front of us 2025. So thank you all for late participation on the Asian side and early participation here, and I look forward to our next session. Thank you.

Speaker C:
Thank you very much.

Speaker B:
Thank you very much. Barrett We're.
