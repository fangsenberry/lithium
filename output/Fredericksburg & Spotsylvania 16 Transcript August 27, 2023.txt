Speaker A:
And this is the wing of a meeting who is study about how the foreign worker can work in this country. And they have an examination which they haven't done. The system where system is developed, the examination. Once this examination passed, they can get actually work visa permit in Japan. I think agencies now working together through the Kanazawa University to receiving those education possible and complete to stupid or complete education. Maybe not a good idea, but the people who really wants to work and who really wants to get educated. So we get scholarship, we get the housing. Usually you don't get housing. Then we get the skill set for those people to work in the local economy. We have a system just started building up which is encouraging and which we could expand to the other parts like India too. But India is very expensive. Find out. It's funny though. The Indian now is a worker gets about $100,000 US. While Sri Lanka same kind of worker. The India is very expensive actually and so is the Chinese. But Sri Lanka educated one even get $50,000 more. I think this is really cheap source of labor as well as intellectual worker. How we tap into it, how we educate it. Japan or our economy is losing many people. So this is actually going to be an interesting work to do. You're talking about long runs, about 30 years. But we could start this program as of probably next fiscal year.

Speaker B:
That's great. Elvaro, good afternoon.

Speaker C:
Good afternoon, sir. How are you?

Speaker B:
How did the race turn? Say, how did the race turn out?

Speaker C:
Improvable, sir. Improvable. Well, but you had no, no, I had great fun. But it was probably the worst outcome in many years. But it's okay. I'm getting old.

Speaker B:
But having fun.

Speaker C:
Remember that getting old is a process of graceful degradation.

Speaker A:
Well, you get wiser. That's what it is.

Speaker C:
We try.

Speaker D:
I hope so.

Speaker C:
Very interesting documents we got today for the meeting. Really fascinating. Thank you for assembling the list.

Speaker B:
Well, here in the US. It's not really deliberate, but there's this very naive just brushing aside this BRICS meeting and things like that and not really coming to an understanding of the she visit to Africa and all these things. And it does come together into this alternative world order, as one of the articles points out. Something's going on. And I think our grouping here, it's good that we can at least think through this.

Speaker C:
It has the potential to become a watershed. But whether the potential will become a reality, it remains to be seen.

Speaker B:
Right.

Speaker C:
But especially if India and China get together behind it, then it's going to be really growing fast.

Speaker B:
Well, Modi was basically my term, but basically intimidated to end up going to the BRICS because he was not intending to go personally. But then he went and looking back 60, 70 years, 50 years at least, I could foresee a detente situation between China and India in a very practical way. I don't think it's out of the question.

Speaker A:
It's happening, isn't it?

Speaker D:
Yeah.

Speaker B:
I mean, she and Modi met in South Africa, so those should we should try to look at it that way. What could this evolve into?

Speaker A:
I think we've been saying that last half year. We're looking at more than half of the population against us. If we are falsely or stupidly creating a sphere here, it's going to mess. We're going to lose if we don't really stick with them. In other words, I hope we get.

Speaker B:
General away or Nishi San can talk to the Korea, Japan, US bilateral and what they really think of it. Because here, no one really talks about it, quite frankly.

Speaker A:
There was two days, we talk about it's gone. Nothing. Nobody talk about newspaper, nothing. But one day everybody was talking about we probably feel sorry for the Korea, as last week, I said, because they are having a much harder time with China than Japanese.

Speaker B:
Well, Korea's been sort of the Poland and Ukraine of Asia. It's the battlefield. And historically historically, yeah. They have a hard situation.

Speaker A:
Their country is actually basically confucianism, but they chosen Christianity because they hit Chinese and Japanese since, what, something like a 500? Where are the bikings? And we batter their coastline and Chinese is coming in and stuff will step on them. So there are always victims. I feel sorry for them, but historically, they hate us.

Speaker B:
Alex, good evening. And John, good morning, by the way.

Speaker E:
Good morning. So aren't the Koreans confucian historically, though?

Speaker A:
Historically, yes.

Speaker B:
But it's a huge Christian community in Korea.

Speaker D:
Wow.

Speaker F:
Right?

Speaker E:
I mean, that's what, 20th century.

Speaker B:
Yeah, but it's a big impact.

Speaker A:
They had to change. We ruled 100 years there. Chinese ruled probably 500 years there. And so they don't, like, see, the Japanese and Chinese use the same character originally, but the Chinese evolved in some wrong way. But Korean is using it's called Hungary. Completely different language. And it's almost like a sign language there.

Speaker B:
But very educated Koreans also know Chinese characters.

Speaker F:
Yeah.

Speaker A:
Young people like Sarah's age or even early 30s, they cannot use the Kanji anymore. I mean, Chinese character anymore.

Speaker C:
Previously using the Chinese characters until one of the Emperor decided to change it all to fanatic.

Speaker D:
Right.

Speaker C:
They dropped away.

Speaker A:
Well, they still use the Chinese character for outside, but not inside. If you go India, if you go Korea, you don't see any of the Chinese character anymore.

Speaker B:
Good evening, Mr. Gao. We're having an informal talk. We're talking about Korea and the use of the Chinese characters and the changes in Korea.

Speaker A:
Arubaro was asking something.

Speaker B:
Alvaro, you had a question.

Speaker C:
A few high level Koreans that I met, very few. What I got from them is a perception. They are very aware, although silent on their past imperial heritage. They are very strong on their heritage. They have a long history and they are aware of it, and people that are aware of the history defend it eventually. So the nightmare that we all have is a reunification type like Germany, East, west with a nuclear armed country. Nobody looking into that scenario.

Speaker B:
In Seoul, Korea. They're very careful to maintain in museum quality the palace, the original. Yeah. Most people don't talk about it, but it's there.

Speaker A:
It's there. We know. But what the crazy thing is, from 38 parallel, it's just only 100 km away. The Seoul is the center of the Korea, and now it's very close to the Pyongyang. I don't understand that way of the thinking.

Speaker B:
Federico, welcome back. Hope you had a great summer.

Speaker G:
Well, not bad, not bad.

Speaker C:
Thanks.

Speaker B:
Jonathan. Welcome back.

Speaker D:
Thank you. Good to be back.

Speaker B:
Peter, how are you? Are you home?

Speaker C:
Good.

Speaker E:
Phil yeah, we just got to port. I was in Las Vegas this week looking at some incredible technology, and I was a huge winner at poker. In fact, they may have closed the casino down. I won $10. So that paid for half my cab fare back to the airport. So I feel like leaving Las Vegas ahead is a win anyway. I saw some just really just staggeringly. In fact, it's going to be the largest investment I've ever made, individual investments. So I did that. I was out there for due diligence for two days and glad to describe.

Speaker F:
It if anyone's interested.

Speaker E:
And then we're in Portland, Maine, now for two months.

Speaker B:
Oh, wow. That sounds very nice.

Speaker E:
I'm working on Ukraine stuff, so I've got to travel for that. So I'm trying to figure that out because I got to get to a skiff, and I think the nearest skiff is in Massachusetts.

Speaker F:
So I'm still trying to navigate that.

Speaker E:
But we'll get it working. There's definitely some uptick in interesting Ukrainian activity.

Speaker B:
Robbie, good morning. We're not quite started yet, but most of you know Robbie. But Robbie's going to talk to us today about the Executive Order on technology investment. Peter, I don't know if you and Robbie have ever met, virtually.

Speaker E:
I know.

Speaker C:
Hi, Robbie.

Speaker E:
Nice to meet you. I'm Peter Bloom. Nice to meet you.

Speaker D:
Hey there, Peter. Robbie, nice to meet you.

Speaker E:
I'm looking forward to your discussion of the EO. That should be really interesting.

Speaker A:
Great.

Speaker B:
And Robbie and I, next in a couple of weeks, we'll go see Mr. Gao. We really look forward to that.

Speaker D:
Oh, cool.

Speaker E:
When you were at Net Assessment, did you know Devin Cross back then?

Speaker D:
Phil?

Speaker B:
No, I really only dealt with Mr. Marshall. It was sort of a unique 20 year relationship.

Speaker D:
Okay.

Speaker B:
In fact, Johann and I once met outside Mr. Marshall's office, who we were both surprised to see each other.

Speaker D:
Got it.

Speaker A:
Okay.

Speaker E:
Understood. Understood.

Speaker C:
Yeah.

Speaker E:
I had the pleasure of dealing with him a few times, briefing him. It was a pretty interesting experience.

Speaker B:
Sonoto, I saw in the news this morning there's a pretty big typhoon brewing out that way.

Speaker A:
Three of them coming to this island probably later on next week.

Speaker B:
The one I saw, it looks like it could hit southern Taiwan and go into Fujian. I don't know. I hope not.

Speaker A:
It might not come into Japan, but I think it might go to the China, maybe Shanghai. But this year is actually not really much. Too many typhoon yet. Usually the average is about eight per month. But still, this is like a 10th typhoon.

Speaker B:
Peter, I don't think you got caught up in the hurricane out towards La.

Speaker E:
I did, actually. Weirdly, Phil. I landed that night in Las Vegas, and it was uneventful. But then I left Las Vegas, and a few hours later, they had significant flash flooding on the Strip. So somehow I caught a 48 hours window with no, I mean, there was a little bit of flooding when I was there, but they had canceled a bunch of flights. But it was a non event.

Speaker B:
Jacques, good afternoon. And Devinda. Good morning. Tyvin, good morning. Zidia. Hello, Victor. Great to see you again. John Alton and I had a great time meeting in person with Victor this past week.

Speaker A:
Oh, I forgot. This week we started releasing this contaminated water from the Fushima power plant, which had a disaster twelve years ago. Our main big topic is actually Chinese government decided to import all fresh fish from Japan. We are having a very internal debate.

Speaker B:
Right now, but everybody knew this was coming. It's just that the date arrived, I guess. So with everybody's. Okay, it's time. So let's get started. And again, most of you have met Robbie Green. He's one of our colleagues and is with us when he can be. Robbie lives and works in the Washington, DC area. So, Robbie, maybe just quickly reintroduce yourself. And then Robbie's going to talk about the new executive order, which has been in place now for a couple of weeks. But Robbie's done quite a bit of work on it and is going to talk to us a bit about it. So, Robbie, please go ahead.

Speaker D:
Yeah, sure. Thanks, Phil. And hi, everyone. I know some of you with Hamadasan over in Tokyo, and he's very gracious host. But just for those of you who I don't know, I used to join these more often and then recently had a I'm less my attendance has dropped off, but I'm Vice President Chief of Staff at a consultancy called Potomac Global Partners. We advise financial services firms, private equity firms, hedge funds on a number of risk and strategy issues. Prior to that was working at the Treasury Department, was a senior advisor there. Prior to that, lived in Beijing, was a visiting scholar at the People's Bank of China School of Finance at Qinghua University, and was also a fellow with an organization called Program on International Financial Systems, affiliated with Harvard, and was working a lot on US. China us. Japan track to diplomatic efforts related to financial services issues before that was a consultant in the financial services industry. So anyways, I'm here today to talk about this new Outbound Investment executive order. And I think a lot of people have all sorts of questions about it. I would say there's certainly a lot of what we call misperceptions around it and hopefully this discussion can help clear those up. But just to recap, for those who have not been following on the 9 August, there was an outbound. For two years or so there have been rumors about this outbound investment executive order potentially coming out and all sorts of rumors as to would it be a reverse CFIUS? How intense and structured would it be? Who would run it? Would it be the commerce department? Would it be the Defense Department? Would it be the Treasury Department? There were all sorts of questions and rumors about what this program would look like. On August 9, the mystery was solved and the Executive Order was released, was issued by the President Biden. And interestingly, it came alongside an advanced Notice of proposed rulemaking by the Treasury Department which has broad authority to establish and administer the Outbound Investment restriction and reporting program that's contemplated in the Executive Order. So if you've noticed, I've been very careful not to call it an outbound investment screening program, which it is not. It's also not a reverse cyphius program. So that is something that has entered the lexicon. That is what some people had wanted it to be. But that is not what it is. Frankly, it's much more analogous to it's structured much more similarly to some of the treasury sanctions programs. Now, that can make, when I say it, that sounds like it's more intense than than people had thought it would be. I think it all depends on a lot of unresolved questions. Right. Ultimately, the Treasury Department is within.

Speaker E:
The.

Speaker D:
Executive Order is very specific to target three areas of technology AI. Quantum, semiconductors. Now, it also makes clear that within those subsectors, the treasury is not contemplating doing restrictions on investment. They are contemplating doing reporting on investments, but they aren't contemplating doing restrictions on investment for what seems to be most AI and also a lot of the semiconductor space as well. So that said, what an advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking means in the United States is that we're very early on in the back and forth process, right. Just two weeks ago, or last week, it all kind of blurs together. There was a bipartisan letter that came out from Matt Pottinger, who used to work in the Trump administration and also President Biden's former Undersecretary of Defense. And so ma, we were encouraging for Congress to kind of get involved and make this a more robust program. I think a lot of people who were hoping to see a reverse cepheus or something more stringent are disappointed by this. I think Secretary Yellen, ultimately, she kind of hinted in Beijing when she was last in Beijing and remarks she gave that she didn't really like the idea of this altogether, but she's gone along with it and has clearly influenced it to be as close to what she wants as possible with a few kind of caveats there. And what's also interesting here is just as you have Republicans calling for a more stringent version of this outbound investment program, you also have Republicans saying that it's too much. We don't want to go. Like this is not the right path. And so that would be Chairman McHenry of the House Financial Services Committee in response to that bipartisan letter calling for it a more stringent program, the House Financial Services Committee PR office put out a statement on Twitter saying outbound investment is fundamentally it was a pretty harshly worded statement. So the whole debate is interesting because it really actually doesn't fall along traditional party lines. There's a lot of concerns about how the program is ultimately going to be stood up. Everyone knows we're very early on in structuring this thing up. And finally, just to kind of get into the nitty gritty a little bit more, some questions that I think are important questions to monitor and features to monitor for this audience would be one. So it's kind of like an old normal sanctions program. However it relies heavily on to understand what's impacted. It's going to rely heavily on technical terms that are more what you would usually see in an export control. So like a Commerce Department export control. So how are those technical terms going to be crafted? Are they going to be crafted in a way that make it easy for a private equity fund that is contemplating a deal to be able to diligence? Are they going to be able to make sure that the target company that isn't actually doing AI, that has military uses? Those types of questions that's going to need to be able to be diligenced. Another question is what ultimately is the scope within AI quantum and semiconductors of what has a reporting requirement versus what has a restriction? Not everything is going to have a restriction, as I was saying earlier, what's going to have a reporting requirement instead, treasury has been pretty clear that this won't apply retroactively and they're proposing to exempt public market and private market sorry, public market and many other types of private market investments. But the actual range of private market investments that will be prohibited, that remains to be seen. And a lot of that hinges on kind of to what extent is the outbound investment program? How does it define a number of key terms such as foreign sorry, the particular, the covered foreign person is the particular term. And how will a covered foreign person be defined? Because right now treasury is contemplating a threshold whereby a firm that is not mostly engaged in a covered activity but has a subsidiary that is would actually and that subsidiary accounts for a minor part of its overall revenue or whatever, that potentially could not be covered. And that's going to be a question of debate and that's going to very much impact for the major technology conglomerates. The other thing to look, and this is very important for foreign firms, and particularly US persons working at foreign firms, is there's this whole concept of knowingly directing investments. And if a US person who's working at a foreign firm is knowingly directing investments into a covered company.

Speaker E:
Basically, if.

Speaker D:
A US person is working at a foreign firm and is doing things that a US firm couldn't do, would that person be found liable to be violating the program? And if so, could they face criminal charges? That's the question, right? And that's a big question that impacts US persons working at countries that are covered by this Executive Order. The other question is to what extent does this impact US affiliates of covered companies as well? Which then gets to the final thing I want to say, and then I'll pause and we can talk about questions. The Executive order is explicitly only China focused, right? There was all this question about in the lead up, there was all this talk about, oh, well, it's maybe not going to be only China focus. They were very clear that this Executive order is focused on China. Now, a lot of people can look at that and 1 may look at that and say, oh, this is the US targeting China. The other way of looking at it is it wouldn't make sense to do a program like this against some of the countries that are oftentimes bucketed alongside China. Like Russia already has a very robust sanctions program targeting it. So these same kind of scenarios being contemplated here don't really line up with wouldn't make sense. So that's another way of looking at it. But one consideration and then I'll stop would be that the Executive order is very clear to say that it's not just about Chinese companies, it's about companies that could be under the direction or control of China. And so that is going to be something that companies will need to diligence if this goes forward the way it does. So I could keep on talking about this for the next 45 minutes, but I'll pause there because I think I covered a lot of the top level points in my view. There's a few other things that we could dive into. I'm just happy to answer any questions people may have.

Speaker B:
So thanks a lot, Robbie. Federico, would you like to present an initial comment on this?

Speaker G:
Well, to be very frank, I have not direct experience in this kind of thing, so I cannot comment that much. Rather than being interested in what happens, of course, clearly whatever thing is somehow direct in the market and the development of technologies has an impact. So what we are seeing here, and this is my reflection in more general, broader terms, is that we are little by little seeing something that is a bit unexpected. So some years ago it was this fear of the coupling in which the western world was seeing rather China creating a parallel economy and a parallel scheme, as they say, against us. Whilst if you see the buildup of the recent years, it's actually somehow, let's say in general the western world. So not just the US. But globally, the alliance that is, let's say centered with the US. To the US. Creating some kind of, let's say, directions for which we move in a parallel world. I think in the short term doesn't matter. In the long term this has an enormous impact. So that is something that we might question in long term in terms of being aware that, let's say we have to decide something that is coherent somehow. Nobody knows exactly long term strategies, or at least they are not that discussed here, not certainly in international debates and I don't see this discussed on the press or whatever. But you have a number of actions taken maybe to cope with needs which are huge in the short term that will have long term impacts and that will be very difficult to reverse at a certain point. So I think by a market perspective this is something we should question ourselves. Is that where we want to go? Which I think could be could be better maybe than other scenario. But I would see this as something that comes ahead of just responding to potential risks that we are starting to assess, given the concern that we have that China's intervention in the economy might impact our way of living, the democracy and so on. Because in the end we have to question ourselves about the kind of system we will live in 510 years from now. So this I think is a common sense assessment. Of course, I do not have anything to say on the specific of this kind of, let's say, orders, which I perfectly see and understand in the context of what we see today. What I don't see, because it's not debated neither in the US nor everywhere else, is where we finally want to head.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Federico, great to see you again. And Peter, you have your hand up and I was going to call on you anyways from the tech perspective. So thank you.

Speaker E:
Well, actually if it's okay, rather than comment, I would love to ask Robbie two questions. Is that okay?

Speaker B:
Sure, please go ahead.

Speaker E:
So, Robbie, two specific questions. What will the Chinese do in the near term and in the long term to reciprocate what we've done? And my second question is I was confused and you clarified it, so I really appreciate that. But let's say that I have an investment in a quantum computer company. Do I have to get and I understood your point about it's really about reporting, not approval. But do I still need to get approval or could it let's just say that I wanted to sell this hypothetical quantum technology, the Chinese, do I sell it to them and then just report to the Treasury Department, or do I have to ask permission from the Treasury Department before I sell it to them? I'm still a little lost on that point you made, which was really for me, very clarifying already. I just need more clarification.

Speaker D:
Rob yeah. So you're not alone. So first thing would be to the Chinese response, and I would say we're still very early on. I mean, this is public information, right? Jake Sullivan was saying how this is going to be a topic of conversation when Secretary Raymond meets with her Chinese counterparts in Beijing. Goodness. Like next week. So this executive order will come up. It's not finalized. I mean, the executive order is out, but the program is not finalized. We know it's going to cover AI, quantum and semiconductor microelectronics, but it could very well be. We don't know what subset of those technologies will ultimately be subject to outbound investment restrictions right now, at least. Speaking of AI, AI, it's written in a way that the intention at least seems to be to make it a very small subset of AI that is targeted for restrictions. And a lot of it would not be, but we'll see how this ultimately shakes out. To get to your question about from the investor perspective here at home, how does one's interactions with treasury work? A few things. One would be that first of all, it's in all likelihood not going to be retroactive. Right. So if you have current investment now, that said, there is a provision that treasury may, if it needs to start collecting data on past transactions, right. So that is in there. But looking ahead, the question becomes you're nailing it on the head, like, what does this operationally look like for an investor? And I think it's going to treasury from just an operational perspective and a good government. We've made the decision that the US's. Government has made the decision. It's moving forward with this type of program. One of the questions that will have to be solved will be is the line between what is reportable versus restricted clearly delineated? Because if it is like a sanctions program, which it seems to be, you don't want to step into the restricted territory. Right. If you step into the restricted territory, well, then you're effectively violating a US sanction. So one needs to be able to effectively understand where that line is. And that's going to be a challenge. Right? It's going to be a challenge. And even if that line is clearly delineated, one will need to be able to diligence to make sure that they are squarely, not in the box of what is truly restricted. Now, the implementation timeline here I don't think we're going to see this program stood up until maybe this time next year. We'll see. But this is very difficult. It's a very difficult operationally difficult to do. And I think that the Chinese response I mean, there was a few statements, but it seems to have it hasn't come out as an immediate in my view, the Chinese response has been relatively how to say? I think it's recognized that this is early on. I think it also recognizes that ultimately what the Biden administration put out was what the kind of the more moderated towards China voices in the Biden administration like Secretary Yellen. It aligns more with what those individuals their policy preferences versus the more hawkish members of the Biden administration. That's my view on that. This program ultimately is more in line with the Secretary Yellen's of the world rather than the more hawkish voices.

Speaker C:
Thank you.

Speaker E:
So I have to say I've read a ton on this. Your explanation is the clearest and most informative. So thank you. I have one super quick follow on question.

Speaker A:
Super quick.

Speaker E:
So if you violate ITAR, you kind of get a slap on the wrist. I mean, it's not saying anyone would intend but I've been involved in a situation where there was sort of a gray ITAR question and the penalty was honestly a slap on the wrist. And then we said, okay, fine, no problem.

Speaker C:
We won't do it again.

Speaker E:
What do you expect the penalties to be if a company either intentionally or inadvertently crosses over into that category that you characterized as restricted or prohibited? What would happen?

Speaker D:
Yeah, it's a good question. Right now, my initial gut is that it wouldn't be a slap on the wrist. The advanced notice of proposed rulemaking contemplates criminal violations.

Speaker C:
Okay.

Speaker D:
Now what did that ultimately look like? What's the threshold for that? I don't know, but I can't speak to that. I would say that that's where it's going to be more analogous to a traditional sanctions program. Got it.

Speaker E:
Okay, thank you very much.

Speaker D:
Really appreciate the yeah, and then one would just you know, again, in the executive order itself, actually, it says how that treasury would refer potential criminal violations of this order to the Attorney general. So I mean, they are contemplating criminal violations. But again, we don't know what the threshold I mean, it can't be emphasized enough that this isn't even a proposed rulemaking. It's an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking. So what treasury basically did is they put out a long document that said, here are 83 questions we have about how to stand up the program. They gave people 45 days to respond. So if you're tracking about one response every two responses a day, you're going to maybe get there. So it's probably going to get extended the common period. And then they basically treasury proposed a bunch of proposed definitions for how it's going to define these very important terms. Now what. Happens next is there'll be a proposed rulemaking, and then after that there'll be the final rule. But that'll take time.

Speaker B:
Elvara, are you raising your hand there? Did you want to say yes?

Speaker C:
I have two questions, and sorry, maybe they're very imprecise. I'm not very prepared in this matter. One is a specific one. I read in the premise of a national emergency declaration, is this necessary? Because otherwise the congressional route should be followed. This allows then the President to go straight or not. And together I put the second question, the reason why I'm making this question, because what United States does usually European Union does later copied. And therefore I'm trying to understand, because for us it would be important. Is this the main trust more a technology export restriction, or is it more a capital control restriction? In other words? Okay, I end here. Thank you.

Speaker D:
Those are great questions. Those are both very good questions. So to your first question, I would say, just generally speaking, most sanctions programs being done via executive order are grounded in AIPA, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. So it's kind of boilerplate language. The President declares a national emergency, and then that enables there to be a sanctions program. So if you look at the Chinese Military Industrial Company sanctions program or sanctions programs, we've done targeting all sorts of individuals and actions. There's Global Maginsky Act, which is more anti corruption. We have IPO, which is for national emergencies. So there's certain underlying statutory authorities that the President can use to stand up a new sanctions program. So that's the answer to that. With regards to your other question, basically, I wouldn't read as yes. That's just kind of like how procedurally it has to be done. With regards to your other question about European countries, I guess by the end of the year, the European Commission and I'm not a Brussels watcher, but I believe it's by the end of the year, the European Commission is going to publish its proposal for an outbound investment program. And Germany is also kind of doing its own assessment of an outbound investment program. We will see how far that goes and whether Brussels actually moves ahead with something. I mean, the Biden administration has been clear that I think that they are talking to G Seven partners, and they would like to see G Seven partners have something similar to this. So obviously that's inclusive of Japan, and I would let Hamadasan speak to this, but my impression is that just as it is in the US. There's folks in Japan who like the idea of outbound investment restrictions, and there's people who don't. To your question, is this a technology restriction or a capital restriction? It's a great question. Right. So the whole program is being kind of the talking points are that this is targeting smart capital, right? The idea is that capital is, of course, fungible, right? And so money that comes from one source doesn't come from the other source, it's going to come from another one. So the idea here is that what the US. Government is concerned about is that and let me rephrase that what the Biden administration is concerned about is that certain investments carry with them non monetary benefits, whether that be in the sharing of expertise, whether that be in the prestige associated with a certain fund investing in a certain company, which then allows that company to go ahead and say, hey, look who invested in me, this big American fund. And now I can raise. So that is what they're seemingly concerned about, these investments that bring about these non monetary benefits. That's the Biden administration's talking points. But there are other forces, I would say, within both the and, you know, Congress certainly, and this is all based on public information that certainly their statements publicly suggest that they would like this to be more of a capital control. I mean, at the end of the day it is restricting capital flows. Right? There's no doubts about it. How expansive that will be and what conditions it will be based on is up to be determined. So yes, maybe it's trying to go after smart capital, that's capital nevertheless. And so it's effectively what looks more like a sanctions program, but it has some features of an export control.

Speaker C:
Very much, sir.

Speaker B:
Lewis, you have your hand. Thank you.

Speaker E:
Yeah. Great stuff on this. It's fascinating. Perhaps if we go for the theoretical to the practical, just give some of my observations from a market participant who looks at this live in real time. Halbaro is a really nuclear missile type question right to the heart of the matter about whether this is a technology story or a capital story. It's a hybrid of both, as Rob has pointed out, is the panache of some Californian west coast firm investing in some new technology. In know the second order effects are huge. It's interesting that in your conversation, Rob, you brought up Yellen and you bring up Sullivan. So for me as an internationalist, I see Jake Sullivan as a real problem for the global economy. To me he is an orchestrator supreme of the kind of trouble that we're in. Janet Yellen has great hudas in China. It's well known to us in markets that people made fun of her having the mushroom soup and that she went all doolally, et cetera, et cetera. But she's a voice of reason. And as a central bank, formerly a central bank official, she is highly regarded. And I'll put it to you, love to hear your feedback. My sense is there's a tension within the White House and within treasury and within Jake Sullivan's purview that basically on one side you have this hammer and tongs Jake Sullivan pursuit of an end game. But there is wisdom and caution coming from the Yellen side, the practical business end of the scale, as you've highlighted a couple of things to think about is, one, there's quite a long process before the rubber hits the road here the meeting about the meeting, et cetera, et cetera. So that's part of the process that to me suggests time. And I think one of the other really important Pragmatic things here is how much early stage capital is going into China versus liquid market investment into China. So, for me, what's really crucial for a lot of the people in the market know. The VC guys in know. Yeah. It's trying to dumb down the money that's going into China, but if they're not closing off the capital, the big lumps of capital going into China, my sense is there's a bit of carrot and stick going on here. And why I mentioned this is if you look at the chat that I posted, don't you think it's interesting, A, that this is all happening when China's currency is on the know? So they're really tightening the screws and capital. To Alvaro's point, this capital flow is really important in terms of the leveraging and this pull and push pull. There was not much. In fact, I had not seen any commentary by the Chinese about Fitch's downgrade of US. Debt, given that their second largest holder, the Chinese didn't use this as a stick know, to beat the Americans, when, you know, why did Yellen go to Beijing? My earnest sense is she was already in negotiations or having conversations with Fitch, understood that this downgrade was coming, and went to the Chinese and said, hey, look, this bad stuff is going to happen for us, and we certainly do not want you guys pushing this treasury thing over our heads. So where I'm coming from is I kind of feel like that there's this sizing up of two opponents and realizing that if they go too far, they're going to push everything over the edge of a cliff. There'll be a point of no return. And you see it in Europe. We were talking about Europe. The European members of this group, you can see European conglomerates, mercedes Benz, diamond, all of those big croup, all of those big European conglomerates that do big business in Asia. They're kind of pushing their governments and know thus far, but let's not go too much further. There's certainly some sense of counterbalance within the business community here in Europe. And I think also in the United States. Elon Musk saying that we're conjoined twins. So where I'm coming to is that the exports talking about timing out of the blue for first time in four years, china starts to buy Boeing planes for the first time, even though they've just announced the launch of their I don't think that the planes complete exactly with each other. But they've just launched their own national aircraft program for a major aircraft. So where I'm coming from is that I think that we're starting to get to a point where both sides realize that there's not much room. Further we're at the edge of the cliff and if we keep pushing each other we're going to end up in a really nasty scenario. And my sense here is that this act is going to take time. There is room for liquid investment rather than the non public style of investment. And I'm just arguing maybe it isn't all as doomy and gloomy as maybe the press and the divided press that we all read on a daily basis is trying to portray love to rob to hear some of your thoughts and feedback.

Speaker D:
Yeah, sure. I certainly think that some of the reporting about this outbound investment executive order has been pretty off the mark and that there is whether it be because just people misunderstand what it's doing or because there's a desire to hype things in a certain way I mean who knows the motivations. I can't speak to that. But there certainly seems to be misunderstandings regarding know there's plenty of public analysis that talks about the differing views within the Biden administration with regards to topics like and it speaks to the fact that this isn't a partisan issue in the United States. I mean there's Republicans disagreeing with Republicans and there's Democrats disagreeing with Democrats. So the coalitions here are not kind of Republicans versus Democrats. How do we feel about outbound investment? There's Republicans and Democrats who are aligned more or less and Republicans and Democrats who are disagreeing with their counterparts about this. One final thing I'll note well I'll put the full analysis our firm did on this in the chat just so people can have it. But one thing to note that could change the timeline is that we have the National Defense Authorization Act here in the United States which is the annual piece of legislation that's passed it authorizes certain programs, et cetera. There is a provision in there currently that would in the Senate's version require an outbound investment reporting program. Not restriction but reporting program for a broader range of technology sectors. So not just quantum AI and semiconductors but also certain satellite and laser technologies as well. So if that were to be passed again from an operational standpoint it would be who knows what the timeline for implementation would be. But if Congress were to require say that the reporting program that they're contemplating should be set up in six months I'm just being just you picking a number. You could see a situation where text and the NDAA influences the implementation of the executive order, the program contemplated in the executive order. So those are two separate things. But it's possible for Congress to require a program that's similar to what's contemplated in the executive order which then inherently would impact the implementation of the executive order. So that's another dynamic to watch that could cause the timeline actually to move much more fast.

Speaker B:
And the NDAA just referred to that is the National Defense authorization act, which most of you know is the trillion dollar muscle behind the whole thing. Roberto, if you could make some comment now, viewing this from your perspective, where a lot's going on in Latin America, we're reading in the past also, and then like Alex to comment as well, but the BRICS summit just completed. And this morning in the Signal chat, I just posted the family picture, which I found quite jaw dropping, quite you know, you have a current president and a former president in that picture. If you could give some perspective to all of this. Thank you.

Speaker F:
I feel hi, everybody. You may remember that in different occasions I comment that my understanding bricks is an acronym in Search of a Soul. So my take is that maybe it found its soul and it seems to be the soul under all heavens. But at the same time, I think that we should think about the mind and the money. Let's think about the practical things. You mentioned the former president of Brazil, who now is the president of the bank, BRICS. So I think that we should all keep an eye on what will happen with the new development bank or the so called bank breaks rusef. I don't want to be critical of her, but there's one thing that I believe she's not very used to, is the digital world. I think her mindset comes more from heavy industries, investments, and a different moment in time in certain ways. So I think if the Bricks in some way may have found or is in the line to find a soul, I'm not sure about the mind. So we need to check what the priorities will be, especially when we think about allocating money. So this is the first point. I think that what many countries in the global south are looking at is how can they tap on that force and especially resources that maybe the UAE and KSA will bring to the new development bank. So we should have a look at that. It's in the media. And I was reading the media in Brazil this morning about some of the tensions and the different worldviews that emerged during the meetings there in terms of language that would be used, in terms of expanding the number of members of that acronym search of a Soul. So now we have an extended acronym, search of a Soul. Right. So I think what we need to look at again, how the bank will be capitalized, the policies that they will establish, how they will use their money, but also how the whole dynamics in the block, let's say, will play out. The second thing related to that is Argentina was different countries suggested different. So Russia had suggested Iran to join the group. Right. And there was a discussion about which country in Africa, sub Saharan Africa, should be invited to be part. Right. And Senegal was also being concerned, and Ethiopia was accepted as part of the BRICS Group and then the bank. We should have in mind that Ethiopia hosts the African Union. And from Latin America, Brazil suggested Argentina. The thing is that Argentina is having elections on October 22. Nobody knows exactly what will happen there. In practice, the country is dollarizing. So private citizens and businesses are only signing contracts in US dollars, not in local pesos that are melting. So whatever people want to do, reality is imposing itself, the economy. And I think also there is a story there about it's very hard for a country to build capitalism with the capital of other people. If you don't have savings and you don't manage properly your own capital, it'll be very hard to have a stable economy. One interesting signal about that is that the largest bank in Brazil, which is called Ita, just left Argentina. It was announced yesterday. They sold their operations in the Argentinian market. They have operations all across Latin America, Colombia, Mexico. I think that operation in Mexico is ten times larger than the operation in Argentina. But they just announced that they're leaving the market. So they sold that to a local bank, Banco Macro in Argentina. That became the largest retail bank in Argentina. At this point, for sure, a good thing to see is if they will have pesos to be deposited in their savings or check account. That's what happened with pesos. But talking elections in Argentina, talking like in America, there were some interesting developments in a small country, Ecuador. Very interesting. If you have not been there, I would strongly advise you to do wonderful nature. The Galapagos are in Ecuador, so we could all pay attributes to Darwin, but they are also having elections in Ecuador. The second round of their elections will be on October the 15th. The whole political process has been contaminated by violence. One of the runners was assassinated a few weeks ago. And the overarching thing, it's a thing that in some way resonates throughout Latin American violence. How crime is more and more becoming embedded into the political process. And this is a dramatic situation, and it also is a very challenging situation in relation to institutions in the region. I think the whole war on drugs has been a tragedy in Latin America. It has costed a lot and it has proven not to be effective. Violence is ramping up and the influence of gangs is increasing in the region. I think that everybody who wants to see the danger of that should have a look at El Salvador. It's a country that today has 1% of its population, more than that in jail and what will happen there. It's also an example of how populism from the left to the right could be extremely attractive in moments when institutions are not proving to be effective. But at the same time, the election in Ecuador had an interesting component. Together with the poll, the national poll, they run what do we call that? They ran a poll, a referendum, in which the population was asked if oil fields should be developed in the Amazon or not, and they said no. So Prav is the first country in the region that has voted to ban oil exploration and the development of oil fields in the Amazon. And that comes with a lot of meaning. Again, I started mentioning the Galapic because biodiversity is essential for what Ecuador is. But we talked also in different occasions here in this group and during this wonderful call that we have all Saturdays about carbon markets, about the sustainability opportunity challenge comes with the cost. But I think that we will see more and more countries in the region trying to capitalize on their natural resources. I personally see that as an issue that really is a function of technology and mostly business models that are not in place today. But we will see more movement in that direction. Brazil, which is 50% of South America in terms of population, GDP size, whatever metric. It's working on developing an ecological transition plan or program that would cover two or three decades and with different layers to different projects and initiatives, from really enacting the legal pieces that will create the carbon market to whatever things, protecting the forest, supporting the development of clean tech industry, so on and so forth. I think we will see more and more of that in the region. On the beginning of September, right before the UN Assembly, but bundled connected to the Climate week there on the 13th and 14th, brazilian investors who are arguing that it's based will meet in New York. I'll be there too, to talk climate investment and climate transition in Brazil. So I think more and more we'll see this type of opportunity, this type of thing happening. And very interesting, in recent weeks, I talked with some colleagues in business that are more and more developing relationships with European partners. I believe that, you know, they're not the president of Brazil, but if I were, I would put on the table a joint Brazil European Union fund to drive green hydrogen clean energy. I think that the vision is not here, right? But I see lots of opportunities for that. Finally, just a fourth comment that's not about Latin America, but it's in some way about bricks, right? India, I think that Jacques shared that on our group chat this week. What India has done this week, it's massive. Landing a probe, landing a rover on the moon. Their program, their space program is by far the most effective, cost effective in the world, probably to a rating of between ten to 20 times more cost effective than others, for sure. Their capabilities that they don't have yet. Right? But this also, it's a signal, I think, circling back the conversation to the BRICS. There are certain capabilities that countries like India and China for sure have that the others don't so the BRICS itself is a very heterogeneous growth. Right. But I really want to praise, I think that, again, what India has achieved is amazing coming from the emerging world. And I was attending international astronautical conference in Paris last year. I was very impressed by the institutional innovations put in place in India to advance the new space economy. And by that I mean, for instance, creating the new Space India Limited, that's the commercial arm of their space agency ISRO, and really creating processes, tools, procurement, IP, licensing process to enable private sector to go into the new space economy that's quite unique in other countries, quite unique in the emerging world. I think we should all praise that for sure. Let's see how it plays out. And just to close and to comment about Latin America, the challenges in terms of institutions and the different capabilities and the different issues that countries in the BRICS acronym have Brazil. And I was having a conversation with colleague actually a colleague just published an old pad in Brazil about some of the reforms that are needed for those of you who follow the Brazilian situation. Brazil is a country, the global south. I think you have heard about that country. But Brazil has passed in the lower chamber in the Congress a proposal to reform a tax system that's the most complex tax system in the world. That will be a big booster for the economy, but at the same time, to give a flavor on the challenges that the country faces and that countries in the global south face in terms of institutions. I was commenting, this colleague who's a business leader in Brazil and just published an Opad this week, if we look at all national assemblies or the legislative branches in the world, the Brazilian Congress, the Senate, plus the lower chamber combined has the second largest budget in the world. The first is the US congress, the second is Brazil. If you imagine the sizes of the economy and you think of that in conversion to GDP, you can think about the challenges that a place like Brazil has in terms of modernizing public sector, modernizing institutions to build a competitive economy. That diversity we find in the BRICS. So we may have clues about the soul of the BRICS. Let's think about the mind. Let's think about the money. I'll stop here.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Roberto. Jacques, you asked about the decision making process of bricks. If you could just articulate your question and then we'll try to get others to answer. But also, you sent two articles this week relative to EU and Europe on AI and Data. If you could just offer some you thank you, Phil.

Speaker H:
You know, springboarding on what has just been said by Roberto, I mean that BRICS is more and more every day and consistent. And it doesn't you know, I don't see how, beside making some big picture, they can get a decision making, having a consensus on anything on this one. Countries are so different, they are so different interests, they are so different agendas. So really I would be very interested to have your opinion about what is the future decision making. And by the way, I was a decision made to introduce new participants in BRICS because before the meeting I thought that for example, India and China may have a totally different objective on this one. So just understanding what has happened and what will happen on this one is very interesting. And of course I would like also to congratulate our friend Devinda about the landing on the moon. I did it in writing, but I think your country deserves a lot of pride about that. So that was really my question about the decision making in BRICS, because the strengths of BRICS in the future and its influence will be directly related to his capability to make a John decision and not an ADOC kind of decision. One by one, going back to Europe. Some of you may have noticed that the Digital Service Act came into power last Friday. Digital Service Act philosophy basically is to say when something is forbidden in normal life, the same thing has to be forbidden on the Internet on that and any very large online platform there, you find nearly everybody from Facebook, TikTok, Amazon and so on will have to obey to that kind of thing. And if they don't, they could be fined up to 6% of the company annual global sales on that. So this is an act with teeth, really. This is really organized around five basic ideas. One, these companies will have to remove illegal content as soon as they are notified by national authorities or individuals and they have to do that very quickly on this one. The second idea is that they will have to keep a lead on harmful content like disinformation or bullying. And this has to be done also as soon as they are notified. Third one, they have to create into their system a way for users to get power on what is happening on the system and all these networks. They will have to end all the targeted ads that they have been running for years. And last but not the least, of course, they have to reveal really how their software does operate so that the European Union, I mean the Commission, can have a look about whether that respects the four previous one. So this is coming into force today. For the moment, only 14 or 15 large companies are being listed as being targeted on this one. I'm sure that list will evolve in the future on this one. But basically the philosophy just to come back to the first thing I say is anything illegal in the normal life has become illegal on the Internet in EU. If for the company, we want to operate in EU and we will see whether this kind of thing is taken on board other countries or some other areas in the same way the previous regulation was done. I was born there.

Speaker D:
Phil.

Speaker B:
Thank you Jacques, very much. Alex, now, in line with that and the article that we had this week about the multi trillion dollar digital economy for ASEAN, ASEAN seems to be steadily proceeding on development. So if you could give us some reflection overall. Appreciate it.

Speaker C:
I will start with a few background things. First, I would like to share about Thailand development. So in Thailand, Tatsin, who was exiled for 15 years, is bad. And at the same day the new Prime Minister is being selected. The interesting thing is that the initial move forward party will have won a little bit of majority. No, it's not really a majority. I mean, it's a greater winner of overall election, probably about one third. And the second one is Thai. Well, just as number two and the rest, you don't want the number one to win. This is how a democracy election can work by what's it called party working together, not really about the people who elected them. Now eventually, right now what you have is Putai working with his arch enemy was military and eventually they now secure the Prime Minister petitions. Likely that Aksin will be pardoned, but we never know until everything actually happened. So this is what we see as world is happening and democracy basically as a game that can be played. Now I turn over to look at what Robbie gave a very comprehensive briefing about executive order. But I'm looking at the whole thing as what's it called decoupling or derisking perspective, starting off from the commercial loan. So for data from Economist magazine that we see that China is now dropped to the number three importer for us. So you can see that the effect of the decoupling is working. But what we see also is that the supply chain and the value chain has really changed and extended. They are more costly to really look at it from the commercial perspective. From the US perspective, yes, the reliance of China has reduced. They begin to have import more from Mexico and surrounding other countries and all this country will become a French shoring or near shoring country. But what we didn't see is that all these French shoring or near shoring countries are still greatly rely on China for their supply chain. Because you really look at all the supply, the upstream raw material, a lot of them are from China. Midstream components made by China and downstream assembly is where they moved it. So their example is that assembly line could have moved to Mexico or India or Vietnam, but they still need a lot of upstream raw material and a midstream component. So now the problem right now is not really about US and China, but the French shore country. They must maintain a very delicate balancing act between the US and China. All.

Speaker A:
Right.

Speaker C:
Without China, they won't get the raw material, but without the US allowing them to do it, they won't be able to sell the stuff to United States. So for a company, is the country really where you move to? Is it safe or not? It's actually a big question. Depends on geopolitics and depends on a lot of things, just like what Roboto mentioned about Argentina. The election coming and we really don't know what the answer could be. So the company will eventually need to distribute and start having a lot more bases or manufacturing bases, supply bases. So the cost will increase exponentially. Not just the value chain operation cost, but also the legal cost. So just as Robbie has briefed that we still do not know what the executive order will be. How does it look like? It is a very interesting situation is that we'll be talking about this one for the last one year and the EO come out, and then you're going to take another one more year before any of the tangible rule can be clarified. So you're talking about two years of confusion. Now. What does it actually mean for the business? If the purpose of this so called decoupling and EO is to slow the development and innovation, then it works and works very well. Not talking about blocking or anything, but just to say, stir shit and let the whole thing become a total confusion. Now you're seeing the effect of it. The investments now is being pulled back, right? So you saw the media, what's it called? Initiative. They're talking about how bad China economy is and everywhere else. For example. So the FDI, the foreign direct investment into China is reduced and China needs to adjust its capital deployment to move away from the property and manufacturing. And ultimately you need to move into internal consumption, which is moving more from current 40%, 60%. This is what China intention is, but I think you have to accelerate that. So in this kind of situation we look at, it is that US didn't win because the cost and price are higher. But I don't think it's a major concern for United States because it can still print its way out for the time being. China didn't win either, because capital employment and changes are a lot more challenging right now. So I'm seeing the situations that you probably take about maybe ten years to eventually settle into balance, that people begin to understand that where I can do, where I cannot do in this multipolar world. All right, so are we ready for this turbulence and what can topper US? I'm not too sure about that. Now I'll just switch over to talk a little bit about the bricks color situation before we come back into looking at ASEANs and the digital space of it. So in G Seven and BRICS, but interestingly, before the last conclusion, they are all non Muslim countries. No Muslim country as in G seven. Neither is it in the bricks. But what we see that there are many of them are queued up Muslim country like Iran, Indonesia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, UAE, et cetera. Many of them. So the original four or five members are friendly to Muslim. Okay, we're not talking about ISIS, we're not talking about terrorists. Basically they are pretty welcome of the Muslim army except India, because their modi situation is that he's trying to balance his relationship with the Muslim neighbor like Pakistan and Iran. And you also need the Indian Muslim who are mostly outside to earn returns for his forex. So modi's situation actually is quite delicate this time. Three out of six Muslim country. All right, so you have KSA, UAE and Iran. I mean, the picture is quite interesting that you see that Iran is in black group and KSA is in white, and the Islamic voice is finally being heard and it will be louder. So modi's life will be a lot more challenging if you didn't play well and balance. Now, the other one is interesting that I think Roberto also highlighted that Argentina is admitted, and this is interesting because its head of state is absent from the meeting. But unlike the Saudi Arabia and UAE, argentina is a country that need help because it depends on IMF lifeline. So it is a country that needs help instead of making the bricks stronger and more prosperous, although it is also a major raw material producing country. So it shows that the BRICS is more inclusive. I think that is probably a good PR and willing to help other countries and of course, to win off the usage of US dollar. So the wild card is what Roberto mentioned is that will Argentina still stay close to BRICS after the election? We still do not know right now. Brick currency, as most of us predicted, they will not happen. But the new settlement mechanism is essential for the local currency transaction. We've been talking about local energy transaction for ASEAN and we have implemented it. And it is a move clearly to prevent the US from being able to control and sanction them. So you can see that other countries are not worried. G Seven not worried about being sanctioned because they are all friendly together, but the rest of the country are all worried they're being sanctioned by the US and using too much US dollar. So now when using a local currency transaction, it is not just prevent the US Austria from making a cut on the transaction. In about a year time we see that the volume go out and the dependence on the US dollar reduce. The brick LCT local currency transaction will have the impact on the executive order that Robbie has mentioned because a lot of things that is not visible to us through the US dollar, things can happen. So I guess that this may be a kind of a culture mechanism which we begin to start looking at a lot of digitalization, especially the peer to peer digitalization. So in ASEAN, acceleration into the digital space is accelerated, accelerated so much that almost, I mean, there's a digital minister for every country right now. They are constantly in discussion. The very first part to talk about will be the local currency transaction. That is the part that we start seeing taking root. And all the transactions, if they are done digitally and using the Central Bank digital currency, it will be very difficult. It will be very difficult for external party to eventually to know what are the transactions outside of this space. Bear in mind that CBDC is like a cryptocurrency, but it is not cryptocurrency, right? So you can enable a lot of peer to peer transaction and things could happen on chain, but the chain is managed by individual country. So unless you are able to tap into everybody, it is very difficult for you to know all the transaction. Now, they will create an environment that every country will feel that it is safe. So I think the payment part is actually the major big part that everybody will be playing now going forward of it. It is probably go beyond just a payment because when the systems are all connected, all right, the clearings and as well as the government's coordination, et cetera, is all connected, you begin to see that a lot of things can happen in the digital space. Of course, the second part on it will be the artificial intelligence part of it. Now, for that, I will probably won't be able to comment whether it's going to be safe or not. But what we are seeing is that it is accelerating of communication, accelerating of transaction acceleration, of very much collaboration. And artificial intelligence will play a very important role behind it. And what we need to watch out is actually the people who use it. AI by itself is actually benign. It's just a tool. But how the individual use it is going to be a very big, what's I call, question behind it. If we do some simulation and eventually we look at it, it probably take about ten years for auditing to settle down. If that takes about ten years, the usage of the US. Dollar going to be reduced. Now, I think John asked about how the decision making is going to make eventually. I think it's all through digital. But one of the very big question I have is that does brick growing eventually will replace United Nations. Let us sink in, because everybody depends on the brick transaction system ultimately. Will it replace a cooperating body like United Nations? I think that is something that we need to really watch and understand. And looking at the country that's being incorporated, I begin to see the EAEU Euroasia Economy Union connecting with Middle East and Africa. That is how it looked like on the map. The one that stand outside will be Brazil and Argentina. How would they be connected? I'm not too sure. All right then I'll end here. Thanks. And back to you, Phil.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Alex. So, Mr. Gao, for China relative to the BRICS and our discussion today is very core and center, president Xi had a very successful trip to Africa. If you could offer some comments, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.

Speaker A:
I think that first I would like to review the history of BRICS so that can help us to understand the spirit of BRICS. The idea of BRICS was first given by US.

Speaker C:
Economists.

Speaker A:
I think it's the chief economist of Goldman Sachs, Jim O'Neill in 2001. But the first summit of brick four was in 2009. So at that time it's only four countries brazil, Russia, India and China. And I think why 2009? It may be mainly because in 2008 the global financial crisis. And that given lesson for the emerging economists that we should not let only us to set the global economic agenda so that the emerging economies should enhance communication and cooperation and we should have our own summit. And one year later it's 2010, the first enlargement of bricks South Africa enter the brick floor. And then we have five countries. And after 13 years we have now the second enlargement, the next six countries enter BRICS. And as I know that there is more than 40 countries enter BRICS, and about 23 countries formally deliver the application documents to enter BRICS. And then we choose the six countries. And we think these six countries is the representative of Global South. And they are all we should say that maybe middle scale countries of the global south. And we think that after the second enlargement, the BRICS could have a more important role in the world economics agenda. And of course we think that why so many countries want to enter BRICS. You know, that not only because the US China competition, but also Russia is also inside BRICS. And although Putin cannot attend, he can just give the virtual speech to the BRICS summit. But anyway, Russia is inside BRICS. And why so many countries also want to enter BRICS? I think mainly because BRICS spirit can help them first. I think I agree with that. For the many Global South countries, they want BRICS to help financial support. Of course we have the BRICS Bank and that maybe can help them. And the second year for many Global South countries, they do not care about US china competition or geopolitical competition. They just care about the right of developing. So any national institution or any countries or any international organizations that can help their development, they would like to engage with that organization. So I think this is very important, and I agree with our colleagues that maybe because China is also a developed country, so maybe we understand them more, we understand what they think and what they want. So I think this is very important for the BRICS development and to coordinate with the global source. And I think maybe one of the keywords is the right of developing. And about when. I think in the beginning of our talk, notto talk said about after the release of nuclear contaminated water, china now gave the sanctions on Japan's. Fresh water, food. And I think this is a little complicated. And in Chinese society, many people I think really many people are concerned that they do not know whether the nuclear contaminated water is harmful or safe. But they have a very simple insight in their mind is that if it is safe, why not Japan keep it on its own territory? But now Japan decided to release it to the ocean. So many people in China, they really get fury and they concern that the ocean will get polluted by the nuclear and maybe the seafood will get polluted by the nuclear radiation. And I think I know that IAU did not oppose the release, but for Chinese people, for Chinese government, what they concern is that at first the decision make process is not so transparent and we do not know about the detail date. And the second is that the release will last for about 30 years and we do not know what will happen maybe ten years or 20 years later. So that really concern us. What I mean is that let's recall about twelve years ago, in May of 2011, I remember it very clearly that our former Premier Wenjabao visited Japan with South Korea former President Lee Mingbo and Japan's former Prime Minister Noto Ken. And they visit the nuclear disaster area Fukushima and they even eat the fruit and vegetables there. And I think that's very amazing and because at that time the three countries have the basic political trust. But in recent years in this area, this region, we lost political trust. And maybe the new milestone is the joint statement of David Camp, the joint statement that really hurt more about the political trust. So I think what we should here maybe to rebuild the political trust and to reset the communication. But I will stop here.

Speaker C:
Thank you.

Speaker B:
I'm glad you brought that up, Mr. Gao. I remember very clearly, as I'm sure Noota does, when Premier Wenjabao went to Fukushima, it was a very wonderful event, actually at that time. Roberto, you have your hand up for a comment?

Speaker F:
Yeah, a quick comment. Thank you for your comments, Mr. Gao. I very much like that. So the way I think this, and I think you made this idea crystallize my mind. We know three things about the BRICS. One, those are very diverse countries. Two, there's an interest, a very practical, pragmatic interest in the money. And three, there's a common threat all those countries, they feel the pains of development and that's something that countries in the Gomorph may not understand.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Roberto. Our tradition oh Avaro, you have a question or comment.

Speaker C:
If I may add something, there is another dimension that I never see talked about. But if we go back to history, and it's a very weak analogy, but you have the Persian Empire and you have these very diverse Hellenic entities, the Spartans, the Greek, the Athenians and so on, they were almost hating each other and very OD, but they had a common fear. And I think that deep down in the mentality of many of these BRICS countries, they know that on the other side they are very lonely, that they are trying to film warms together. That's my way of looking at them. They are facing entities like United States that have twelve carrier fleets, each of them capable of annihilating all of them. So I think the fear element they need to bend together to create a unity in case of need to prepare for this is very vivid, even if it's not spoken about.

Speaker B:
Thank you. Thank you very much, Alvaro. So, our tradition is the opening comments. That person is given the credit to give some summary and closing thoughts. So Robbie, please.

Speaker D:
Yeah, thanks. So, I mean, it sounds know, in addition to the outbound Investment Executive Order, the other topic on everyone's mind was that up to Bricks Summit, which was quite interesting to watch. I think a lot of the comments analyzing it have been quite interesting, particularly, Alex, your comments about the financial element to it, your comments about the history of Bricks I think was very insightful. As for where this all goes, the one comment I would just make with regards to the financial integration angle is that there's a lot of talk about central bank digital currencies. I always feel the need to just say that in the context of bank to bank or large value transactions, we effectively already have central bank digital currencies. All central bank liabilities are effectively, with the exception of cash, are digitized. I mean, that's the backbone of modern finance is digitized central bank liabilities reserves, central bank reserves which are assets on the balance sheet of commercial banks liabilities on the balance sheet of central banks. So to the extent though, that BRICS countries are trying to find new ways to digitize central bank liabilities and use those as a backbone for new payments and settlement clearing infrastructure, that will be an interesting trend to watch and will have effects from a geopolitical standpoint. And so yeah, I think the overarching theme between the Executive Order and that is just on what rules does financial integration, or geopolitical integration for that matter, under what rules of the game does that take place? And there's a lot of debates right now as to what rules would be appropriate for various channels through which cross border traded finance could take place. And those debates will continue. But I think there's reason for optimism that ultimately some of the differences that we see today can be reconciled and that that ultimately that a lot of the debates we're having about how these financial channels should be structured will ultimately result in more efficiency and healthy competition, and hopefully we can end on that positive note.

Speaker B:
Thanks again, Robbie. I'll just say, Robbie and I will be in Hong Kong in about two and a half weeks for a forum of the China Research Development Foundation on economics, where Robbie will clearly glean a lot from those interactions. And then we'll be up in Shanghai and meet with Mr. Gao, who's very kindly arranged an invitation for Robbie to attend a special forum there as well. So, thank you for everybody. And one just sort of salute Admiral Miller's on the phone. He can only listen. He's driving today. But a salute to Lewis, because Ireland today is the host of the Notre Dame US. Naval Academy football game.

Speaker D:
So.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Ireland.

Speaker E:
Dublin actually is nuts with Americans. There's actually an American cruise missile destroyer in our Dublin bay. We've been taken over.

Speaker F:
It's great.

Speaker B:
Well, it's a pretty special event. So anyways, thank you. Have a great week, everybody. Thank you for all your comments and reflections. Appreciate it. Thank you.

Speaker D:
Thank you.

Speaker F:
Thank you.
