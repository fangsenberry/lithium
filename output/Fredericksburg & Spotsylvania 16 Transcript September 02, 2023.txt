Speaker A:
Hey, Tom Sato. Are you in Israel? Tom, there you are.

Speaker B:
Hi. Yes, I'm in Israel. I'm just trying to prepare my presentation.

Speaker A:
Oh, no, you don't need to talk or anything. I just wanted to check in, make sure I was okay.

Speaker B:
Yeah, everything's fine and I'm in Israel and I'm working on this presentation.

Speaker A:
Okay, you take your time and no need to talk, but I have the screen sharing set up for when we start.

Speaker B:
Thank you very much.

Speaker A:
All right, look forward to hearing about it. Anything else? Noto for now.

Speaker C:
Yeah, no, it's just that I'm still going to get the visa, so if the niche agrees I think he's agreed, but if China side is okay, we might actually go china on 10th.

Speaker A:
Okay. Come back twelve so next weekend?

Speaker C:
Next week, actually.

Speaker A:
Well, the 10th is Sunday.

Speaker C:
We don't know yet.

Speaker A:
Yeah, okay.

Speaker C:
But China side haven't give us any clue yet, so we don't know whether it's acceptable times. We just be there after we talk face to face.

Speaker A:
But you said that he wants you to come, right?

Speaker C:
Well, yeah.

Speaker A:
Okay.

Speaker C:
But he said during the field, your visit is not convenient for them too.

Speaker A:
Right, yeah.

Speaker C:
Understandable.

Speaker A:
I'm the following week, so it's fine.

Speaker C:
Yeah, either following week or before the week. That's that I couldn't read all of them today.

Speaker A:
Well, Tom will lead off focus on oh, now he's on the beach in Israel.

Speaker B:
I'm staying right here by the beach. This is this morning. It's really nice here.

Speaker A:
If Jonathan Paris is on the call today, he'll recognize that for sure.

Speaker B:
Okay.

Speaker C:
Yeah. Tabula Satan. The big one. Both of the big ones. I have a nephew with me. Is it this is chicken.

Speaker B:
Yeah.

Speaker C:
I'm having avogado Mexican rock for the dinner.

Speaker A:
Mexican rock?

Speaker D:
Wrap.

Speaker A:
Oh, wrap. Okay. I thought maybe that was a new type of.

Speaker B:
I'm organized now. Really? I just started my trip and Israel is really nice and hot and sunny and beach is nice and had a couple of meetings with startups and I'm here for a week. I'm organizing this huge conference where the general the Japanese government sending 100 people to Israel and I'm organizing a side event where the Japanese will get to meet 50 startups in Tel Aviv. And that's really complicated oh.

Speaker A:
In the coming week. So that's great.

Speaker B:
Yeah. So as an organizer, it's pretty hectic at the moment, but after that I'm traveling to Sri Lanka.

Speaker A:
Now. When do you get there? When do you get to Sri Lanka?

Speaker B:
I'm arriving very late in the evening on the Friday.

Speaker A:
All right.

Speaker B:
So I have a weekend to get, I don't know, settled, just to relax.

Speaker A:
I think it's a very nice place.

Speaker B:
I haven't planned anything there, but it's good to finally get to Sri Lanka.

Speaker A:
Well, I look forward to seeing I get there Sunday evening. So we'll see each other Monday morning probably at breakfast or yeah, yeah, it.

Speaker B:
Would be very nice.

Speaker A:
Johan. Good afternoon.

Speaker E:
Good afternoon.

Speaker A:
And Kim. Very early morning. And Kim's out in La, so it's five in the morning.

Speaker C:
Good morning. Good morning.

Speaker A:
It's almost five years, so our sympathies to you and Kim. It's not even 05:00 a.m yet.

Speaker C:
Yeah, we're good.

Speaker E:
Looking forward to this.

Speaker A:
Do you leave from there for Nairobi?

Speaker C:
No, I return to Anarbo Tuesday, very early Monday. And then I leave for Nairobi on Thursday.

Speaker D:
Get there on Friday.

Speaker A:
This coming Thursday? Wow.

Speaker C:
Yes, in a few days. And I'll be neighbor for a while. Nairobi and Chigali, Kenya and Rwanda. I'm going to turn my camera off for a second.

Speaker A:
Yeah, you get yourself coffee or whatever. It's too early.

Speaker B:
Well, I'm happy that I get to speak in decent hours. Usually I'm pretty sleepy while I'm doing this in as.

Speaker A:
I think everybody realizes this is the only time we really can do this. To connect everybody from, in this case Los Angeles to so poor Johan. We take up his early afternoon, but sorry about that.

Speaker E:
Get used to it. But Sundays and Saturdays it could be a problem.

Speaker A:
We have our first cool weather here. It almost feels like autumn, but it's supposed to get hot again Monday, so we'll see.

Speaker E:
It's fall now in Sweden.

Speaker A:
No snow yet, though.

Speaker E:
No, not here, but usually in the north. It will be in late September and the beginning of October.

Speaker A:
Admiral Inman called me from Norway the other day. He said it's been incredible visit. The weather's been apparently very nice. I'm going to get him to come on the call in a couple of weeks and tell us all about what he saw up there. Because they were way up north.

Speaker E:
They have a problem with the water. It's a lot of rain.

Speaker A:
Oh, really?

Speaker E:
Lots of foods and things like that. And have been destroyed.

Speaker A:
Wow. John. Good morning.

Speaker F:
Good morning.

Speaker E:
I have my eight year old with me up here.

Speaker A:
Okay, well, good morning to him, too.

Speaker B:
My office.

Speaker E:
He's going to eavesdrop.

Speaker A:
Okay, that's fine.

Speaker E:
Learn something.

Speaker A:
Learn early. I don't know if you heard me, Johan and John and then Kim, but Tom SATOs in Israel today, so he's going to give us his report from the beaches of Tel Aviv. Or at least the picture says you're on the beach.

Speaker E:
We have had some arguing here about the Nobel Prize ceremony. The committee had invited the Russian ambassador and suddenly the whole ceremony was boycott by larvae.

Speaker A:
Really? Just because you invite the ambassador?

Speaker E:
Yeah, they invited not only him, but among all the other ambassadors. But most of them said no, then all politicians and others. So they have changed their mind now. So he's not invited anymore. People get real upset. Never happened.

Speaker A:
How can we get peace if we can't talk so I don't know. Especially at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony.

Speaker C:
What is that?

Speaker E:
I was invited there once. It's interesting. It's a huge ceremony.

Speaker A:
And Jews. Yeah.

Speaker E:
But no Russians are welcome this year.

Speaker A:
Does that mean we don't want peace or what?

Speaker E:
Honestly, I don't know. You see, it's a real problem. I mean, when we are talking about sending aircraft to Crane and of course it's better for them, but I'm not sure it will have peace. A lot of things will be destroyed unsurportedly. Very few are talking about peace in that region. How to find a way to get peace there.

Speaker A:
Well, they say this one drone attack was launched from Latvia. I hope that's not the case.

Speaker E:
I know, but it's a bit unfair. I mean, to let Ukraine defend Europe and just sending ammunition and aircraft and tanks and whatever, but not get involved.

Speaker A:
Yet. If you get involved, you have to really be committed to be the that's the step everybody is reticent.

Speaker E:
Yeah, exactly. Well, the west is really hyping Ukraine offensive now. The Wall Street Journal had a big article on how Ukraine is ready to penetrate Russian lines and then go in and take back all the territory that they lost. And that just seems very not quite right to me.

Speaker B:
It's not right. Okay.

Speaker E:
They can't do it. They can't beat the Russian. Yeah.

Speaker A:
The Russians can take it as long as people want it to.

Speaker E:
So yeah.

Speaker A:
Hey, Mr. Gao. Good evening.

Speaker C:
Good morning for you.

Speaker A:
How are you?

Speaker C:
Fine.

Speaker A:
We were just chatting before you came on. Noto looks forward to seeing you soon, and then I do, too, in a couple of weeks.

Speaker C:
First I have to get the Japanese also has to get the pizza.

Speaker E:
Yeah.

Speaker C:
See what happens in Monday. I might ask you the letter on the invitation if I need it, but I'm not sure. It seems like I don't need it, but we'll see. So it will take maybe about two or three days to get the visa. Sound like it? Yeah. I'm a walking distance to the Chinese Embassy. I walk over there Monday morning if I can. That'd probably be by Wednesday or third. I can get the pizza.

Speaker A:
Codasan. Good evening. And Jerry halton. Good morning.

Speaker B:
Hey. Good morning, Phil.

Speaker C:
Everybody.

Speaker A:
I met for the first time face to face yesterday, roberto Good. He's in DC and was very nice. It's always nice to meet everybody face to face eventually.

Speaker D:
Roberto are going to be in New York together next week.

Speaker A:
That's what I hear. I'm going to be in New York one day next week on Friday. I don't know if you're there that day, but I'll be there Friday.

Speaker D:
The eigth of September.

Speaker A:
Yes.

Speaker D:
No, not coming into the night.

Speaker E:
Sorry.

Speaker B:
I'll miss you, Jacques.

Speaker A:
Good afternoon, Alex. Good evening. Do you still get there to New York pretty often, Jerry?

Speaker D:
I try to do one week a month in New York.

Speaker A:
Do you still have your house and everything?

Speaker D:
No, but I have a place that I stay.

Speaker A:
Okay.

Speaker C:
Nice place.

Speaker A:
Well, he was introduced on our chat, but young David Wong from Shanghai is at NYU stern as a freshman now, so he's learning the ropes.

Speaker D:
Good. Well, there's two or three faculty there that are friends of mine. I should introduce them.

Speaker A:
Well, with time would be great for you to meet him. And he's a good young man from Shanghai, I must say. Mr. Gao, I think you met David Wong. Did you? I don't know if you did or not, but you know about him?

Speaker C:
I've not met him face to face.

Speaker A:
Right. But he's a good young man settling in. So all is well.

Speaker C:
Yes. I heard of him from you.

Speaker A:
Victor. You're out of town this weekend, right?

Speaker B:
Yes, I am.

Speaker A:
Okay. Angelo, good afternoon.

Speaker G:
Good afternoon to you, too.

Speaker A:
And Dimitri and Jason. Good afternoon.

Speaker C:
Hello.

Speaker B:
Hi.

Speaker A:
We'll get started. Tom Sato is calling in from Tel Aviv. He's there for this coming week to introduce various investors and technologies. So he's going to present us on AI infrastructure, which is a brief that he suggested some weeks ago. Let me just say good morning to Roberto. He's in Washington, DC. We met yesterday, had a great time. And Robbie Green is going to be with us shortly. And again, we thank Robbie for his presentation last week. Howard, I assume it's welcome back.

Speaker D:
Yes, I'm back.

Speaker A:
Wow.

Speaker D:
I might have a stop at 09:00.

Speaker A:
Okay, well, we'll get going, but it's just great to see you back. And I assume everything went well, but it was great hearing from you.

Speaker D:
Everything went well. And we saw a lot of interesting places, including Mongolia, where, unfortunately, tuition had to go to Russia that period.

Speaker C:
And.

Speaker D:
Samarkhan and Uzbekistan, and some of the places that I wouldn't normally get to.

Speaker A:
Wow. And Estonia.

Speaker D:
Estonia. We met with the mayor in Lapland, which was kind of interesting up. And then in Helsinki, we met with the foreign minister, actually. Wonderful, wonderful young woman. I mean, she's 33 or 35. And that's in a pretty amazing country in terms of what they do and how they produce their energy and what they've been doing to take in refugees. It's a country of 300 and they'll hit 400,000 people by the end of the year. They think 350,000 Icelanders, 25,000 poles, which I never realized. It's the biggest immigrant population, and they're taking 3000 Ukrainian in each year.

Speaker A:
Now in Iceland you're talking about in.

Speaker D:
Iceland and integrating them pretty well into their society. It was fascinating. And then we were also in Singapore and Seoul and Kyoto, where I met with Desperate and had a lovely time with but I'm back.

Speaker A:
Well, great to have you back. And I guess we're going to see each other this coming Friday. Louis Kern is going to be in New York, and we're getting together. And turns out Roberto is going to be there, too, and I think he's going to join us as well. So we look forward to getting together later in the week.

Speaker D:
Should be great.

Speaker A:
So, Tom sato coming to us today from Tel Aviv, Israel, and passed along your briefing ahead of time. But you have screen sharing, Tom, as you proceed. So please go ahead. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Thank you. Hello everybody. I'm in Tel Aviv by the beach, and this morning it's really nice here and I'm on this Japanese delegation of 100 business folks to meet startups in Israel. And I'm organizing a side event on the Israeli side for the Israeli startups to meet with the delegation. So that's happening on Wednesday and next weekend I'll be in Sri Lanka. So today I wanted to talk to you about AI infrastructure, global infrastructure, mainly because AI discussion with Chat GDP has been in our minds for quite some weeks now, months now. And I wanted to explain what's going on under the hood, under the subsea cables and the Tokode network and all of that. So let me share my screen of this presentation. You got it? Okay, right. AI requires a lot of power and a lot of bandwidth and very low latency, which means that things have to happen instantly, even if the computational work is done at the server level. So what we need to look at is the global AI infrastructure. Now, this is important and if I could explain it like this. Last time we had this It revolution of smartphones and all these wonderful iPhone revolution, it was backdrop on the mobile infrastructure upgrade from three G to full digital, four G and five G. And when we had the full 4G ate network, we could really do a good job on smartphone application. And we have wonderful application now on our phones. Okay, just like that. In order for us to enjoy AI applications on the edge, that means on your smartphones or on your computers or wherever you need the infrastructure. And this time around it can't be just infrastructure locally for Tokyo or Tel Aviv or New York. It has to be a global infrastructure. And so in today's presentation, what I want to give you is a briefing of overview of this infrastructure upgrade which the world needs and what it means for the government, each government to consider. Because the government, I don't think, realizes that they need to invest again into their It infrastructure for the AI, the coming AI revolution, which is going to happen in next ten years. So today I'm going to talk about the global submarine, optical network, photonic network and data center infrastructure in very layman's terms, so you understand it sounds technical, but not so much. So this is the global submarine infrastructure as it stands today. And it's been laid out mainly by the Telcos, the telecommunication companies around the world for past 20 years. And up until about two years ago, most of the communication lines, fiber optic fiber lines, were of single strand, single core fibers and they were at most delivering around about ten to 30 terabyte per second capacity. They are completely inadequate for the coming AI revolution. AI and the metaverse and everything that is around in this new generation of technology requires an extremely high bandwidth and connectivity to the data center. So who are the players who are going to solve this problem of making sure that we all get to enjoy this AI technology? Well, especially the photonics, which means optical fiber and optical computing. Japanese R and D has been working for past 20 years, and the Japanese, in fact, do lead in terms of optical fiber manufacturing and R and D development. And the leader in Japan is undoubtedly NTT. Now, NTT has been working on photonics and optical fiber for past ten years, and they're pretty mature now. So what happened two years ago is that Sony went to NTP saying that in next generation of global Internet infrastructure, we need optical. We need to band together and create a consortium so that it's all standardized and everybody can work together. So Sony and NTT went to intel and created this. I One Global Forum, which stands for innovative Optical and Wireless Network. It means that you have extremely high bandwidth trunk line with optical fibers and high bandwidth six G network on the wireless side. And these are some of the sponsors, many Japanese, but there's a lot of US. Companies and Koreans as well, you might notice, right at the top, but we have Changwa Wireless, which is Taiwanese token, not Chinese Taiwanese token. Okay? So they banded together to discuss about creating a standard for optical computing and optical network for the next generation of infrastructure. So what is this initiative? It calls for three things. First of all, high capacity, around about 100 times more capacity than what we have. We have ten terabyte capacity at the optical fiber in subseas, and they need to be upgraded by 100 times that's petabytes. You need very low latency. That means that if I switch on something on my iPhone right now, it immediately acts upon at the data center at a very fast pace. I don't need to wait for something to happen. Okay. Also, the electricity consumption in the infrastructure is huge. With current networking, this has to be replaced with end to end photonics, meaning that you are not using electrons anymore. You're using photons to do communication right from the edge at your desktop to the server's internal microprocessor. So that is called photonics. And if you move to the photons, the electrical efficiency is 100 times more efficient because you're not using electricity, there's no heat dissipation, and it's more efficient. So, NTT has many friends in Japan who are collaborating with this. And one important aspect of this communication is the optical fiber. Previously, we had one core inside an optical fiber. Now, typically, you have four cores inside a fiber, which means that there's four line of sight and four lines of communication inside this hairline size optical fiber. And you bam them together in 32 batch of fibers to create this huge cable and they tested it out between Australia and Japan. And the company which was involved in this experiment, NEC OCC which is NEC subsidiary and Sumito Electric which is the manufacturer of the optical cable, achieved 1.7 petabytes transmission speed capacity. This is the kind of bandwidth AI needs between data centers and what they are showing is that it can be done in the subsea level thousands of kilometers away. This means that almost most of the technology required to lay out this global infrastructure is now ready to be deployed. So they are moving into the manufacturing and deployment phase of this. Let's take a look at what's happening inside the data center with the servers, the computers and microprocessors. Well, that's all Nvidia. Nvidia just announced a huge revenue increase. Their data center revenue increased by 175% while data center business for AMD and intel was reduced by 35% each. This is the HDX AI supercomputer which uses new Microsoft process by Nvidia and it is the order of magnitude faster than the A 100 based supercomputer which was released three years ago. At the moment, Chatty DB is using previous generation of machines but if they move to this supercomputer it's going to be hugely efficient and cost effective as well as way faster. Now this is just released, it's going to be deployed in next three years and I expect most of the AI application will be running on this at variety of data centers. And I believe this is the supercomputer the Chinese have tried to procure from Nvidia in Judeo of a couple of billion dollars. So if you look inside the microprocessor of this server and the supercomputer is called Gracehopper Super chip, it's two chips, one is the Microprocessor CPU and other one is GPU. Microprocessor is what you have on your PC and your smartphone and this time around it doesn't have any intel component. It has Arm components for this super chip. It has 72 Arm V nine processors in this gray CPU. Which means that really Arm which is going public in a couple of weeks time, has a huge huge boost from Nvidia business. But also it means that days of AMD and intel is practically over. They need to do something about their microprocessor architecture because Nvidia is taking over the data center business business. And to connect all these servers, we have Bluefield DPU data Microprocessor, data center microprocessor which connects all of these computers together. So that one gigantic data center is now a computer. That's a huge amount of processes. So what does it mean for the government to consider in the light of this new generation of infrastructures? In the past five years, we've seen many of the leading countries placing huge orders to create their own data centers. Even Sri Lanka in their economic troubles have created their own data centers. China, India are creating thousands of data centers across the country, same as Japan and so on, because these machines, these processes, the servers need to be housed somewhere, and you can't do it at your company. It's a cupboard. You have to place it in a secure location in a data center. So the data centers need to be significantly upgraded in order to take on these Nvidia's AGX supercomputers and its connectivities. It also means that the connection between the data centers, whether it's internally within the country or externally between the countries internationally, needs to be upgraded to the new optical fibers the Japanese are releasing and with new ion technologies. So the countries need to think in terms of how to upgrade their infrastructure and getting in quickly such that whatever they're doing right now with the existing infrastructure is adequate for the next generation of AI infrastructure. I think many countries are saying, we just installed 5G networks. I thought it was good enough. Well, not so much. This AI technology, which is coming and it's not going to go away, is going to consume so much power and energy and computational power that not only they have to think about these data centers and optical fiber infrastructure, but how to generate electricity for these data centers. That is another set of huge issues which would involve a lot of thinking in terms of not using fossil fuels because of the climate issues but also to find out a new set of technology which could make sure that they don't need to upgrade their grid, their infrastructure, in order to take care of these, that they somehow could connect directly to the parcels, to the data centers they are building, such that it is extremely energy efficient. I think what I want to sum up how I want to sum up is that now is the time to get the government infrastructure people at each ministry to sort of do fact binding and look at the technology. Options and look at who are the players in these next generation of technologies and make sure that they are fully informed so that when the time comes for them to budget this infrastructure build up, they are well prepared in terms of understanding the requirements and the budgetary needs and how to deploy it for their community and their citizens. Thank you very much, Tom.

Speaker A:
Thank you very much. And there's going to be a lot of interactive questioning here, but let me first call on Robbie Green, because he's on an airplane and will be taking off shortly. Robbie gave the presentation last week on the EEO, which of course, very much applied to the investment side here. And Robbie, if you could also make a comment on your understanding of Secretary Romando's visit to China this past week. So, Robbie, who's on an airplane, please? Yeah.

Speaker E:
Thanks, Phil. And pardon everyone for any background noise. I'll have to be brief. First of all, that was a great presentation. As for the visit by Secretary Romando, I guess a few comments. One, the continuing meeting on export controls are meaningful development. There was a lot of pressure here in Washington to not move forward with doing that. So that was quite a notable development that Secretary Mondo indeed established those periodic export control meetings and also very regular meeting counterparts there once a year. So that's notable obviously another notable comment was the uninvestable, off the cuff remark that Secretary Romando made in between Beijing and that I think that reflects the concerns of some firms in China with regards to some of the political risk that's manifested itself over the last few months. So, all in all, I would say it's probably out of all the recent visit, probably was the highest visit of any of the kind of biden administration officials to China in recent months. And I think from the perspective of whether it meaningfully led to from the perspective did it lead to meaningful results in terms of stabilizing the relationship and certainly seem to reach outcomes that will at least prevent at least it's going in the direction of further dialogue, right. Is the outcome. And again, that's a value neutral statement. That's just what objectively happened.

Speaker C:
The fact that she did that is.

Speaker E:
Meaningful because there was so much opposition to what was ultimately decided upon. So that's a quick readout. Interestingly, it seems that at least official readouts that were published by an investment executive order was not a major topic. Who knows the readout, if that's an accurate representation? But that's certainly an interesting kind of reading between the lines as well. I think, frankly, that's probably somewhat of a recognition that we're so early on in what this program could ultimately look like that there's not a lot to talk about at this stage in the game. So that's.

Speaker A:
So I'm sure there's many questions for Tom and also Robbie, just note, Robbie will be in Hong Kong the 13th and 14 September for a major economic conference, which will include a lot of Chinese and US. Treasury officials. And then he'll be going up to Beijing and Shanghai from there. Peter, you have your hand up, so please proceed. And thanks, Robbie.

Speaker H:
Phil, can you hear me?

Speaker A:
Yes, just fine.

Speaker H:
Okay, Tom, that was a really exceptional presentation. I really appreciate it. I just want to make a few comments to support Tom and point some things out. The first I want to talk about is how you can miss these kinds of trends that Tom is describing. My firm was an investor in a very large data center business. It was called QTS. We took it public. We sold our stake. I think we made several billion dollars. I think we made $6 billion or something. But Blackstone recently bought the firm. They took it private in a statement that basically said, because of AI, they believe that the data center business will be an absolute core of any economic investor in this area. It's now estimated that QTS is worth between 50 and $100 billion because they are the largest AI data center provider in the United States. So we totally missed it, never saw it. We got out almost a decade ago. But to me, it's a great illustration of these secular, huge trends that Tom's describing. The other trend he described, he hinted at, but is going to be really fascinating to watch, is the energy trend. Because, as he asserted, connecting to the grid now is highly complicated and very delayed. So a lot of these large data center providers are trying to figure out how do we create our own energy? How do we basically not be dependent on the grid? And that is a whole new area. There's some people even talking about pebble reactors. I don't know if that's practical or not. I don't really know much about nuclear power, but just this is a canary in the mind for what we're going to see in the future is the consumption of direct generated energy by these data centers. The other point I wanted to make, which I don't know if Howard got a chance to experience this, but they're building some really interesting data centers in Iceland because of the geothermal cooling. And so one of the other issues is know, as Tom pointed, know the power required for both the chip consumption, power consumption. Also cooling is quite significant. And so there's going to be a land rush. This is my prediction. There's going to be a land rush for geothermal cooling in places where you can basically substitute that for power for the purpose of cooling. And then the last thing I wanted to say was, Tom, if you want, I'm an investor in New Reality. It's an AI chip designer in Israel that's partnered with intel to compete against Nvidia. If you would like. They're very successful. If you'd like an introduction while you're in Israel, I'm happy to arrange it. Thanks, Phil.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Peter. Alex, let me just shift to you because one of our articles this week is about Singapore having to put data centers in Malaysia and Indonesia, et cetera, a topic that Tom referred to. So Alex, please.

Speaker I:
Thank you, Phil. Thanks, Tom, for the very interesting presentation. But over at Asia, there's two things that we are currently looking at. Data center is definitely what we are building because there's an ongoing trend for all the decoupling happening. So people really need to make sure that their data center is connected, not to China in a way, because they will cause a lot of issues if they're not careful. So for most of the corporation, a lot of times they will separate their two parts of business they're doing with China, maybe using Huawei and Ali Cloud, and the other part is using Amazon and Google. So data center requirement is quite high, number one. Number two is that how to turn the data center into something that. Is green is another major concern. What we are seeing down here is that increasingly the data center will be helping their own power generation. So the power generation either using ammonia or hydrogen. So in order to build that, most of them will be building in places that is less populated and connected by a high speed network. One of the favorable place will be the Batang for Singapore because it's only a ferry ride of less than half an hour to each day total journey within 1 hour. So I think that is something that is quite favorable. Now, you have to understand that in Singapore context is that anywhere we go should be less than half an hour. So anything that more than half an hour is considered far. But in countries, for example, in China, traveling for one 2 hours to reach a meeting place is actually quite common. But in Singapore that is not what we usually like. So having something in the bottom and allow the project manager able to go to the data center easily, that is some of the favorable locations. So in Malaysia, in Joaobaru, the main thing about Joaobaru is because of the traffic jam crossing the so these are the two favorite places. Eventually there are quite a number of new data centers being built. A lot of them are modular. Today is the kind of situation that we are looking at now. The data center is largely will be catered for the metaverse, type of environment computations, virtual machines, et cetera. Metaverse. A lot of things are now being hosted and moved up. I want to just comment one more thing about the AI situations is that what Tom's Share is largely the investor as well as the large company, especially AI provider that are interested because of centralization, because they will be able to build something and optimize for cost. But increasingly the trust between the two blocks, the east and the west is going further and further. There is less trust in the system right now. So whether a government and whoever want to build their own AI or not, there'll be more people who wanted to decentralize the AI and use it on themselves. So you're increasingly seeing the smaller and smaller AI that will be used by individuals. For example, that if you see the interview with Audrey Tang and her email AI is running locally on her computer. For me, I do the same thing also, although I use a big AI, but I still have my own AI that handle all my personal stuff. The capability is increasingly getting better. So most of the existing machine will be able to run such AI. But we are increasingly seeing that the thing is getting smaller and smaller. Eventually they go into the hand phone. All right, so decentralized is one way and the AI will operate with other AI across the network. Now, do they need to use the AI chip in a server probably very little, but most of the time it will be going via the hosted services. So we are seeing that this is increasing the trend happening out here. Will that be eventually synergized into something? We're not sure about it, but what we are seeing is that the virtual and physical is merging very fast. Why I say that is that we typically think that the virtual world is a virtual world. Just like Howard last time mentioned about the kids playing with robots. So you build something virtually inside. So the virtual property, everything is inside. But in most situation right now out here, they say the virtual and physical really merged into one. One example is that I think I raised this one last week, is that the Singapore digital twin projects, digital twin projects you are looking at is actually a full environment of Singapore. And we simulate whatever happened inside down there before we built, for example, the railroad and we look at these traffic lights, et cetera. Such thing is not new in Singapore. In Hangzhou Alibaba have already done that. So all the simulation is done in the digital twin. And when you know that this is workable and you will implement it in the physical world, so the same set of programming immediately swap out into the traffic light control. Once you are done already, real data collect benefit back to the virtual world. So you're effectively seeing the two part of the world is connected and interacting. I won't say seamlessly, but there's a lot of adjustment between the two. Whatever that you want to make happen, you try on the virtual world first and then you implement it in the real world and you see whether it is workable or not. And the data will be able to push back. So it is quite different from creating a virtual environment for people to what's it called play with like engines and all these things. I think Peter mentioned it previously in the environment, such as training virtual physical simulation for the civil defense. So they will hold equipment, or rather a piece of block that's the same weight as a chainsaw and wearing the goggle. And then they begin to do the training or breaking down what's it called walls and all these things with haptic response from the whole machine. They basically simulate the whole thing before they are able to go out to try out the new things. And they're taking a new input and feedback. So this happened in the military too. We have a lot of simulation and of course the earlier simulation will be the flight simulator. This flight simulator is getting more and more real. All right, so how the pilot use it? Eventually the knowledge also transferred and move into the new equipment, the UI, et cetera. So we are seeing that the whole thing is the line is very blurred. It is not about what we previously think that people will live in the virtual world. People live in the physical world and it overlay with the virtual and the data go in and out all the time and very soon you will not know whether the data is actually come from the physical world or virtual world. Now, why am I highlighting this one is that there may be some form of danger. As you look at the AI, especially the western developed AI is that they are biased. And I would say that it's a form of echo chamber because of the language is used that somehow somewhat as we use further, we realize that the bias has increased. So if AI don't have enough data to train on, you have generated his own data and eventually the bionas will get better and worse. That's part one of it. The second part of it is that we also kind of know that our mainstream media where most of data are gotten from are basically somewhat controlled by the large company. So are they going to be good and neutral? I think the answer is no because for people bilingual or triangle books like me that I will read from multiple sources and realize that the information is quite different. Let's not talk about opinion. Opinion definitely will be different. But even availability of information can be very different. So things happening in Africa, if you are reading the African local news compared to European news, france news and American news, you notice that the focus is different and a lot of information is missing. And for Africa, I think the most neutral news source actually I got it from China where a lot of things are being reported. All right. I think what is very important for us as well as this AI space is that we human will still need to be around to very much focus on the information, the accuracy of information to know what is going on before we are able to analyze and know and nothing beat physically on ground. So I think Robbie making a trip to Hong Kong and Shanghai with Phil I think is very important because you will see physically what is going on. Guys, I will end here then back to you, Phil.

Speaker F:
Thanks.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Alex. Howard, as Peter mentioned, you've mentioned before the power source and power requirements and how Iceland and Oregon were favorable. But if you could reflect on that and from your trip and anything else, I know you have to cut a little bit early today, so thank sure.

Speaker I:
Yeah.

Speaker D:
No, I asked about there are a lot of data centers in Iceland. Actually if you go back a USPC now, a VC, Chris Sacca worked at Google in the early days and one of his charges at Google was to set up their data centers around the world. And he was one of the first to go buying up land in the Dals in Oregon, which has huge hydro power in northern Norway, in Iceland, in certain parts of Asia, because he knew that they would need a lot of cooling in those days and they would need a lot of power and they would need cheap power. What the people in Iceland said, and particularly when we talked, the foreign minister had previously been minister at other posts, was I asked, said you're going to need a lot of data centers, because I think Tom's terrific presentation today highlighted that. He said, yeah, but the problem is the data center comes with four jobs. He said, they're all automated. It's great when they're building them, we have a bunch of jobs when they're building them and we have no jobs. But when we bring these aluminum plants in with huge amounts of power, they bring 400 jobs. And in a country of 400,000, 350,400 jobs is a lot, whereas four jobs doesn't much matter. So they say, yeah, we understand. They want it the same way that the crypto people wanted to use our power and our cool air, and we'll let them. They can do some of it. But we much prefer people who are going to bring jobs along with taking our thermal power. And I think there are places in the world like Bhutan, which has huge hydropower resources, which might be an interesting place to locate data centers for India, because India buys a lot of their hydro power from Bhutan. So if you can convince the king of Bhutan, gee, a data center won't upset your culture because it's only going to bring four jobs, there are places which might like that. We might see some interesting things happening there. I would also reflect that we got the presentation in Talin on the e citizenship that Estonia offers people. So right now, if I want to get an EU bank account to be able to make payments and things, it's almost impossible for a US. Citizen to get an EU bank account. If you move to France after six months, they might reluctantly give you a French bank account that you can use while you're there. But the Estonians let me become an e citizen. It's not very expensive. That lets me open bank accounts and a business in Estonia, et cetera, and fully EU compliant. And they are getting all sorts of people as e citizens, including Bill Gates and Tim Draper and a bunch of others. I think they've got 3000 now, people who signed up for the program. It doesn't give you an Estonian passport, but it does give you all the business rights to do business in the European Union with that eye opening. Plus the fact that Estonia, of course, is now completely everything is done with their electronic ID, so they don't need any credit cards or anything. Everything they do is done with their eid, which has several Pin numbers. It's got one Pin number for your banking, which is a long Pin number. It's got a short Pin number that you use just for exchanging information with other people. And it's got a really well designed system for separating all of your personal information and allowing government systems and private systems to ask for data. But they can only get the data that you allow them to get about you. So they might only be able to get your name and address, or they might only be able to get a piece of a medical record. And they've done much more thinking on this than I've seen anywhere else. So take a look at the Estonian e systems, which they're trying to export now to other parts of Western Europe. And some other players are looking at their structural system for doing it. They also were the place where with the Ukraine, they were able to outsource their data and backup their data in other countries. So, as we all know, one of the things that happened early in the Ukrainian war here is that Ukraine a few weeks before had moved copies of all their data outside of Ukraine, some of which was moved to Estonia. So that if the Russians hacked and attacked, which they did, of course they would have good backup copies outside the country. Estonia has done the same thing because their whole country infrastructure now is an e infrastructure. They have done some deals with Lichtenstein or Luxembourg, I think Luxembourg actually to back up all their data into Luxembourg so that they can keep it going. And I think we'll see more bilateral pacts where people, countries data, this is really very sensitive country data is kept outside the country, at least a backup copy, so that in case anything happens to the infrastructure, in case it gets attacked, and we're seeing these attacks all the time, that will happen. I posted on the Signal Group chat and I don't know, Tom, if you'd comment about the fact that the Japanese Ministry had been hacked probably by the Chinese, and who knows how far in they still are after all of that. But it was interesting to see the difference in e thinking and digital thinking around the world. Mongolia is beginning to think about it, but very little is happening there. Uzbekistan is completely backwards with respect to you can barely make payments with used credit cards in a lot of parts of there. They're still back in that part of the economy, whereas obviously in Seoul and Singapore it's a completely different feeling. We were in Singapore on National Day and you saw all the pride in everybody being able to move around and everything being done electronically by the people there, as Alex know. So anyway, it was eye opening, but the data center world has for many years and Google was the leader in this, been looking at the places around the world, as Tom said and Peter have said, both that have cooling, that have cheap power, and that's only going to continue. I think there are a few places in Latin America as well that don't have the cooling so much as they have cheap Power. And the cheap power is locating near Iguasu Falls, which is in Argentina and Brazil and Paraguay. So Paraguay now has a chance to do something interesting with hydropower and become a data center provider. But as I say, the problem with the data center stuff is it brings some revenue into the country, but it doesn't bring jobs.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Howard, and welcome back. Max Yamamoto, you have a comment in the chat if you would like to reflect a bit on this today. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Thank you very much. So what I just posted in the comment is right now Japan is promoting a card called My Number Card. And what is my number? It's like a US. Social Security number. And different from that, Japanese Digital Transformation Ministry is promoting a My Number card, which you can use it as an insurance card or you can connect with the bank account or by using the My Number card and app, you can ask to civil government to get some official paper like how do you say hi in English. But right now, Japan has several problems of promoting My Number Card due to the there's a lot of people who have the same name and there's an error with that or even for the civil government staff didn't know how to use the iPad very well. So when they help some older people to make the minor book card account without signing out, the next people comes and they put the next person's information and the error came out. So if the person tried to get some offshore papers in the convenience store or something, someone else's offshore documents come out. And that's why Japan still have a lot of problems. And even for the AI instrument capture which Mr. Sato presented yes, I think even, for example, for the Sea cables, as a person who's doing the cybersecurity for cybersecurity policy, I do see some warnings about the security about the Sea balls, but not that much. If I give the name Motohiro Chia is a person who is emphasizing it. But I don't see that Japan is maybe not in academics, but doing a lot of efforts for the cable security, but I don't know, in real life they're doing it, but they're not just bragging about it. Yes, I have a lot of things to say, but I will stop here.

Speaker C:
Thank you.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Max. Jacques, last week you mentioned the new digital services agreement of the EU and the play that has but also this discussion about Power electric power generation. And clearly there are issues looming for France and others. So, please.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Philip. First of all, thank you Tom, for this mind opening presentation of your very interesting. But when I listen to the presentation and to the conversation.

Speaker D:
Probably the issue.

Speaker B:
Of power is probably to be less and less of a problem. If we are able to reduce by 100 the power consumption because reducing by 100 you will find that both on the cooling and all the feeding in of the system. But I am still wondering how do you finance that kind of thing and how do you get your money back? Because clearly up to now, most of the internet has been paid by publicity really in one way or another. Now there are a lot of restriction coming on, on issue of publicity and financing by publicity and so on. And the second issue that the sums now involve in changing all this cable, changing all these centers and so on, is probably far over what can be financed by this kind of revenue. Another point, the users will have to pay for that in one way by a significant increase of their It services. Do you think that will not reduce the market or at least put the market in some places of the world and not available in some other places? So that is really what came to my mind by listening your presentation, Tom, and looking into the chat on the site.

Speaker A:
I will stop there, Phil, thank you. Angelo, I think you're still with us, right? Yes, you are. Angelo, if I could just ask you on the issue of infrastructure, which you've discussed before, national infrastructure in Italy. And now I was just reading some articles earlier today about the fuel sourcing coming out of Africa and Algeria and the BRICS issues. If you could just make some comments in general, but those are what are going on in my head. Please, Angelo.

Speaker G:
I'm unable to do comments in general. I can tell you something about what is going on in Italy. In Italy, as you know, as you may know, just 8% of Italian oil and gas is coming from our sources, national sources. But as a matter of fact, in Italy the potential for energy is much higher. We could easily cover between 30 and 40% of what we need. After all, we are Sicily, not too far from Libya, as you may imagine. But the problem has been that in all these years, for many reasons, one you may see ecological reasons, yes, the left wing governments were very sensible to people saying no, please, no gas in Italy. We don't have to spoil our seas and so on. So as a matter of fact, most of our sources come from region in the South Basilicasa, where there is a lot of oil, but a lot more can be utilized. This government apparently is very determined to exploit the Italian gas and oil sources, our homes. Of course, for doing this you need several years, of course. And I'm not sure that we shall have a right wing government consistently going on for ten years, which will be the minimum for having these policies implemented and being operational. Another issue in Italy now is nuclear power. Nuclear power in Italy is completely absent. We have no plants, no nuclear plants as far as in 19 85, 86, after Chernobyl referendum was done in Italy, asking retalians if they wanted or not nuclear plants. You may imagine 1986, 80% of Italians after Chernobyl say no. And after that time nobody has come again on that decision. But now, apparently this government, and not just this government, even parts of the left, the more visible parts of the left, understands that Italy cannot stay away from nuclear power. Obviously we have nuclear plants in France, in Switzerland, in Austria, in Slovenia and all around. So it's completely stupid not to have in Italy. This is a possibility now it's becoming a serious possibility in Italy. As Afan Institute Italia last February we had a poll, very serious one conducted about the opinion of the Italians about nuclear power. Apparently the University of Sienna, where there is a very good team, did the job. 60% of Italians, now they are in favor of nuclear plants. That's astonishing. But probably it's true. One of the reasons I asked the colleague of University of Siena who conducted the poll, the reason why this was, and they told me that the main reason is generation reason. The people who were afraid of Chernobyl, now they are know, they have new generations. Apparently they are quite powerful, they are not contrary to nuclear power.

Speaker E:
So.

Speaker G:
I see a possibility that Italy is coming back to nuclear. And France, of course, is pushing a lot on Italy and other countries, obviously for selling French technology, which apparently is not the up to date technology. Even the American government now is making some pressures on the Italian government for considering buying American technology for the new nuclear plant in Italy. So it's a field of possibilities. There is no plan precise and no decisions taken at this time. But energy in Italy is from ever is a very serious issue because we have a very large manufacturer. Italy is the second manufacturer in Europe after Germany. We have our manufacturer more or less like in France, perhaps more. And of course manufacturing needs power, artificial intelligence needs old, but of course we have a lot of metallurgic plants in England. And of course, if you do Gucci handbags, you don't need much power. But for breaking other things, you need power. And Italy is probably the weak point in Europe for power, because we don't have nuclear plants. That's essential. We are very good in hydroelectric power, because we exploited the power which is in the Alps, in several other parts of Italy. We have a lot of solar and wind, not that much as Germany, but we have so what we need now, the real issue is nuclear power. Of course, we are ahead. Italy is a hub for gas coming now from Algeria and from Egypt, and from the his replacing the Russian gas. So the problem now the point of real point at stake in Italy for energy is nuclear power and also exploiting Italian proper resources in oil and gas, which are not enormous, but relevant. Thank you.

Speaker A:
Thank you very much, Angelo and Kim. Of course, this brings us to the crises brewing in Africa, and uranium has become very much part of that discussion and challenge. If you could give us an update. We've had obviously another coup this week in Ghana. Yeah. So please and Kim.

Speaker C:
Well, thank you. First of all, thank you, Tom, for that presentation, which was very instructive. You could see how many of those sea lines contour Africa. And starting first with the BRICS meeting that just finished in South Africa a week ago, it's very clear that this kind of modern infrastructure, this kind of foundations of modern technology that governs much on the world is really what China is looking for through the BRICS from the global south. The BRICS meeting, my understanding is that it sort of pivoted much of the global south. The emerging economies, those who have any kind of ODS with the Western dominated system, it pivoted most of them towards China's orbit. Not so much of Russia's orbit or India, but China as the main player with lots of government backed financial institutions to support these countries. So just listening how today is very rich discussion is going, it's very clear that China's birth and road strategy might very well be mostly henceforth a bird and technology strategy. So to sort of embed its systems and markets in this global southern countries, it's already so in Africa, where Huawei dominates the almost entire continental it infrastructure connectivity is mediated 70% by Huawei infrastructure. So China already has Africa? Pretty much. But the global south went substantively towards China with the addition of six more countries to the BRICS to make it eleven. They seem to have been strategically picked based on their, quote unquote, emerging market systems and some kind of stability.

Speaker B:
That.

Speaker C:
Exists in those countries. For example, Nigeria could have been a member, could have been a candidate. Nigeria is the biggest economy in Africa most populous nation in Africa, but they were not allowed, partly because of Nigerian governance problems. There seem to be lots of enthusiasm around the summit as I'm getting, especially Africa lots of enthusiasm. It's very clear that the global north, what we call it down in Africa, global north and Western dominated, become rather pseudonyms for the world, dominated by Europe and its descendants. Last 400 years has been Europe at the top and its descendants in America holding sway. So the rest of the world is looking towards China as an alternative. Now, does China offer any better? It's not very clear, but when you're in a hard place, when you have a history of someone holding you down, then you turn around to any alternative that can give you breathing space. It might end up not being the best. But for now, the global south, by all indications, seems to be going towards China's orbit. Now, that means lots of the infrastructure, treaties, alliances, lots of the mechanisms and instruments that currently govern the world are going to be influenced by China substantively, including WTO, including votes at the UN, including all global governance systems. China is looking for strong cloud now. Will the Global South again get a good bargain? It's not very clear yet, because from this discussion today, as I'm thinking, what does a better bargain mean? It means enough scientific and technical advancement to be able to do this, that we're saying here, that govern pretty much of what we're doing now. So do they have those mechanisms in place? Some have it. But now, being under pivoting towards China, what would it mean for those countries? It's not very clear. But what we know now is just that the Global South increasingly is trying to find its way out of the Global North, out of the global governance systems, by going towards China. Now, for Africa directly, as I think about it, the coup it has in Africa recently, they are not all the same. They're not all the same. I've mentioned that they're all happening in French speaking Africa, nowhere else. As a matter of fact, English speaking Africa doesn't know why French speakers in Africa are doing political because their governance systems are not so dominated by the French titans, by the French government. They don't have that baggage, neither historically nor currently. So the coulators are purely a dynamic between French control of those countries and those countries trying to find some space out that their resources post colonial for what, 80 years now, they haven't fared any better. This is saying in Africa that the worst countries on the planet sent to Africa, they've been one of those regions, are those that endured French colonial rule and are still under French dominance. So they associate French influence with poverty, with backwardness, with absence of development. And that's where you're finding a younger generation trying to push back towards what currently exists. The challenge is that they're pushing back the know how. The content, the understanding of this kind of thing that we're discussing here today, of the architecture of the Commonwealth of the modern world, is not very well understood. So it might not end up being making much of a difference for these African countries. Besides feel good that they've poked their fingers at the French. But I'm not sure how much that would mean much pivoting towards Russia. Many look towards Russia as an outlet. What would it mean for Africa or these countries? Their engagement, their entanglement with the French systems are so deep that it's difficult to imagine a quick disentanglement we've seen, even with the US and China. First of all, reactively thinking of decoupling, where that's not so possible because of the nature of global supply chains and systems. So we're not talking about derisking the same thing with. These African countries are having these coupons they might want to decouple from France, but it's just not obvious that it will happen in this century, because the way that they integrated is so high. Nigeria calls for a particular concern from the French. Again, because of uranium and the French nuclear system. One of the things that is not very well reported, or it's underreported, is that after gas prom was turned off between Russia and Germany, europe looked down to Africa for energy. And they got much more ambitious and put lots of money to simply get the pipeline from Nigeria, where they had more confidence in, through Niger, up north, across the Sahara, up to Mediterranean coast, and to pull the oil out of there for Europe. Those are some of the things that have been negotiated in this coup that's causing these jittery feelings from the global north. It's not only uranium, it's also that oil line that has already been in place. So Niger posed that particular problem because the character of those who took over power in Nigeria are a little bit more reactionary. They are more anti French, anti what you call it, anti colonial, anti dominant. So these are three countries, nigeria, four countries nigeria, Burkina Faso, guinea and Mali. And that's where the biggest concern by the west. Now, the other two cous, the one in Charles and recently the one in Gabon. There are some analysts in those countries that suggest they were not really couriters, as one would think, the rejection of the governor as the other ones, it was mostly an arrangement by the French government itself to preempt a more hostile coup and maybe pre arrange a more friendly coup in advance. So the one in Gabon is pretty much a friendly coup towards France. The incumbent government, they had lost elections and they were trying to rig and maintain their stay on power. The authorities realized that if they didn't do something, then the persistence of the incumbent might lead to problems that might lead to more problems. So they simply ask this military leader to step in. What does it mean for Africa? It's not very clear. It's not very clear. The countries that are in the French system are very jittery. I am from the Cameroons myself. That's where I was born. As soon as there was a coup in Gabon the very next day, the Cameroon government had to shuffle it has to rearrange its military governor systems and personnel to be preemptive. And that's the case with Guinea Quateria, the Central Africa area. Those six countries, they are all under French. So one fell and the other ones are being a little bit preemptive. It's not very clear that this would amount to much for these countries at all. I have indicated earlier that the governance, the levels of power, both economic, political and military, are vastly not under the control of this country. So however they feel themselves forward, they may not have what they're looking for. But it does signal that more and more as the Global South goes towards the east, the Global North has to give some of these countries a better bargain so that they have less contention to deal with them and deal more with geostrategic issues that are on the table. So the next BRICS meeting is supposed to be in Russia, and my sense is that that was really intentional to strengthen with China and Russia at the helm of the BRICS, of the expanding bricks, to make sure that they strengthen themselves, china and Russia especially. You will recall when Xi Jinping visited Russia on his way out, he mentioned that changes are coming, that both of them are going to drive global changes. My sense is that they want to drive a strong expansion of the BRICS and push back on the dollar together by quickly around the Ukraine war, asserting themselves on the Global South, asserting themselves on the globe. One of the contentions was digitalization. Now, after lots of discussions on what it means, how is it practical? I understand many of the big countries don't really want to get an alternate currency. They simply want to use technology to get some mechanisms where trade and commerce can be done in local currency and not on a universal currency, not on any kind of mediating currency. But we do commerce already across payment platforms that you pay in your currency. So the BRICS country are considering a platform for their maybe peck on the CBDCs or other tax instruments to simply be able to do commerce not through the dollar, but through their own local currency and be mediated, maybe a parallel to Swift, but without the need for intermediary banks and clearing currency like the dollar. But nevertheless they are seeking and they may not succeed anytime soon. But my sense is that they are quite ambitious. It's only an objective of theirs. It's a matter of how do they do it optimally and how long would it take. So it's something to keep watching. The six extra brick countries are supposed to join early next year, so they have some time to walk up into some of their details and logistics. So we'll keep watching. That's all I can say.

Speaker A:
Thank you. And Kim. And so Mr. Gao, if you could reflect a little bit from your perspective of the now completed BRICS conference, the upcoming G 20 in India, the UN General Assembly, which is in a couple of weeks, and then the BRI Summit, which will be held in China in October. And how is a good way for us to structure thinking about this. Thank you.

Speaker C:
I noticed in our chat room that Mr. Houting raised a very good question that's how China view biden's EO. And I think that in China we view this in the framework of biden's politic world China in recent two years. And we think that the EO, the latest milestone of US sanctions against China's development on science and technology and in fact that we believe that in Biden's administration's strategy towards China, it seems that now we have two major battlefield, one year political battlefield, majoring Taiwan Street and South China Sea. And just this week US pushed out the new military financial aid towards Taiwan and that make China and the PLA very angry. And about the second major battlefield I think is science and technology. And just I think in this week when Secretary Remundo visited China and she said that US will never try to decouple with China and of course we believe that, but that's major in commercial side. But on science and technology, we think that US years launched a new cold war on science and technology and of course I think the outcome will be very sophisticated that will of course raise great challenge to China and Chinese government. But of course on the other side, I think that if you look at the history of China and you look at the personality of Chinese nationality, we have a basic experience that in China we call Huan. That means you will thrive in challenges and perish in soft living. And now since we are in the great pressure and challenges in US sanctions on science and set will give great stimulus on China's own research and the development on science. Just this week on the day that Secretary Remando arrived, huawei pushed out the new type of 5G smartphone, page 60 and we think that it used 5G chips and we think that that's very encouraging Chinese people. That means of course we know that Huawei is under severe sanctions and is of course in the focus of US BIS. But in the last several years, Huawei still can make great progress and can develop its own 5G chips. That's very impressive for Chinese people. And of course we know that to destroy China's science in fact is dumping US chips in a very cheap level. But if US use the methods of sanctions it will of course not cut off China's science development. So I think that will have a very sophisticated influence on China. We cannot say that it's a good but of course it will have a long run influence on China's development and on the way of China's development. But anyway, we think that we will of course survive. But of course, I think for many specific Chinese companies they are still trying to find the space and find a way how to engage with US partners, how to do business with US commercial side. I think this is very important and of course summit. We hope that President Xi and President Biden can have a good meeting on sunlight. But for China we still wait and see. That means that in the recent years friend Xi and Biden have face to face meeting and have online meeting. But US government cannot always follow Biden's promise and his words. So we will have to see that how many fruits the US government can really follow the promise of the summit. And we will not only see the world, we will also see the action. I will stop here. Thank you.

Speaker A:
Thank you. Mr. Gao, if I could just now getting towards the end reflect on the security side. So ask Johan to really give the state of security relative to Ukraine and other issues going on in Europe. And then Admiral Koda, if you could make some comments relative to the just completed trilateral and the security situation. So if the two of you could just try to cap off a discussion from a security perspective. Thank you. Johan, first please.

Speaker E:
You unmute me.

Speaker A:
You're ready to go?

Speaker E:
Yeah. I'm not sure what you really want to hear, but I mean the security now in Europe, I think what's difficult here right now is in Sweden that because of the Quran burning and things like that is a very high security here and people are afraid what could happen. But nothing has happened so far, but it's high readiness here. And then of course, you see here. The problem as far as I see is that now we are sending a lot of military equipment to Ukraine and now people are especially this country, and I believe even in other countries. Is it possible for us to send more now or do we need it ourselves? We never know what will happen in the mean, even if it depends on if you see there is some kind of ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, it doesn't mean that it's very safe and it must have guarantees that it will happen. And if Ukraine gives up, I think that Russia will continue. And even if you have a ceasefire or a peace, I don't think that Putin, as long as Putin is leader in Russia, he will be satisfied. He will look at other places where he believes he can attack, things like that. Then he tried to find friends here and in other places you see Belarus and things like mean. If you look at Europe or how we were looking at peace in the future just a few years ago when we started this conversation we have here and talk about it, it's a totally different picture now. And unfortunately, if you look back at history, europe has always been a very violent place and let's hope it will not happen like that again. So I think that's the reason why people are willing to help Ukraine in this war, but they are very afraid of getting involved in person. I mean, look at this for instance. You have these aircraft from US and even from Sweden that we are supposed to deliver to them. And of course then you need the training for the pilots and it will take some time and they need the aircraft now, but the easiest way would probably be to send them with trained pilots from Sweden or from UK and Finland and Netherlands and Denmark where you have these train pilots. But we will never do that because then suddenly NATO are involved in the war against Russia and this is a tricky situation. On the other hand, it's hard to see that, as I said many times before, just to see that Ukraine now has a responsibility to secure Europe. We can support them with equipment and money, but we don't want to get involved. From morale point of view, I think it's a bit unfair. But on the other mean no one wants to have a world war and there's a huge risk that if NATO get involved in the war with Russia, then there could be a start for I mean, it's a very difficult situation and it worries people. And you see it have influence on the economy and things like that as one for most countries in the world right now. So it's not an optimistic picture we can see right now if you look at what's happening in Europe and in the rest of the world. So that's just a comment.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Johan. And Admiral Kota. Welcome back. In your reflection on security side, Jerry Halton brings up a very good point. Tom Sato gave us the layout of global undersea cables and of course that is a very vulnerable point relative to security in a new way. So if you could just reflect on that and also just a bit about your comments about the bilateral with South Korea and the US. Thank you. Or Trilateral.

Speaker F:
Yeah, thank you. Just Jerry asked the question and we call the seabed security, the security of the kind of network of the undersea fiber optics cables. This problem has been discussed especially between Japan and US navy for more than two decades, but still say due to a kind of the sea blindness.

Speaker B:
It'S.

Speaker F:
Very difficult to convince the political leadership and also the economic leadership about the vulnerability, of course importance of the CBET cables and then the vulnerability of the CBET cables. But say the more we have we experience the cyberattacks, the easier we get to have them understand the importance. Hey, every time we had a kind of serious attacks from North Korea or some other countries, hey, look at this, this is a cyber attack. If the underwater cables have been cut to some extent, situation would have been much worse. And this is how important it is. But still it may take some time. And the other thing is, do we have any real solutions or means to really protect because especially from the cutting side or destroying side? Thanks to the very precise GPS, say willful Nation is able to send their cutting devices at any point in the ocean bed easily and using the unmanned vehicle, even the more than 500 meters depth they cut. And of course, we observed some of the operations by, for example, like china they are making a lot of the surveillances and part of the objective of that surveillance we guess is the locating the key know the fiber optic cables. And another thing is also I think this is Jerry pointed out the vulnerable part is the connecting part between shore station and the undersea water cable up to the maybe ten meter depth and there are so many unprotected fiber cables we call it shore fiber cables. Even myself using the cutting devices go to the shoreline I can cut and I will be able to kill almost all US Indo Pacific military operations easily. In Hawaii I have some pictures so key thing for any countries not only for the free countries like country for China or other countries who really uses the network of the seabed cables we have to do something. And what we are discussing now or making survey now is especially the shallow color water or shore areas using the amend the vehicles with AI and the very advanced communication systems I think in a short time period we'll be able to establish 24 7365 basis the protection, surveillance, the postures against the others and the deep order cable. Still no way to protect but in a crisis or contingency to the wartime if we find out any suspicious maneuvers, send a ship, a vehicle or a man vehicle there and watch them. And if there are some possibilities or some suspicious maneuvers, just go and stop them. This is the only way so far I think. So the white area ocean surveillance for 24/7 basis will be another key but anyway there are problems and now lucky enough one good news is political and economic leadership just started understanding but how we realize our protective measures it may take some more times but we do have some solutions. So this is the quick thing and I hope I answered Jerry's question and then just the US Japan South Korea relationship I think progress we made since last May that means the inauguration of the new Yoon administration. The amount of security progress that three nations have established during last a little more than one year period is perhaps more than 30 times as big as the one we had established during the last 30 years. So now of course there are still many more problems especially between Japan and South Korea. But I think the wisdom of the two leadership are trying to separate the key security issues from other issues and trying to advance what we are doing in security arena further and further, faster and faster and deeper and deeper and my last comment is key is.

Speaker C:
I.

Speaker F:
Think the kind of the emotional nationalism, especially in the South Korean side because the acceptance ratio or support ratio of present Yoon is still relatively low and especially if anything relates with South Korea Japan relationship economy or history or politics other than the security. I think the South Koreans attitude is still very course south Korean, ordinary South Koreans understand and keep silent. But if there is a pull they said no, we don't want to cooperate with Japan. This I think is the average is about 60%. But now I think it is getting better and better. But key thing for Japan is this is not the South Korean only domestic issue. Japan has to cooperate and help the South Korean people to have more productive eyes over South Korean Japan issues. But anyway, you know, the situation today is when I compare the current situation and situation where I was in active duty navy captains and admirals, admiral, I think it is getting far better and the key thing is we have to maintain our momentum. I would say by all means, at any cost in security, this would be the success and I stop here. Thank you very much.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Admiral Codin, especially addressing the question Jerry has, which leads to the summary for today from Tom and from all of us. Thank you for a very professional and informative briefing. If you'd like to give some wrapping up summary comments. Thanks Tom.

Speaker B:
Okay, there were some questions regarding the security of subsea cables and also how to finance this and so on. So in terms of security of subsea cables, because there are so few of them and some country have one landing point and one cable, that's a huge issue. And 30 years ago in Silicon Valley it was like that. In Silicon Valley we had one cable and then this truck driver cut it from somewhere and Silicon Valley Internet went down. I remember this really well because I was starting up my e commerce company back then. Anyway, what happened was that everybody could lay cables and the Internet as a whole has so much redundancy and this problem of one accident here and there would not bring down the entire network. This will happen with subsea cables when multiple countries will have multiple landing points as well. As many of these subsea cables have branching and networking in subsea and we will be less dependent on a single strand of fiber, but there will be multiple points. So it will be very hard to take down a country with a single strike of cutting the lines itself. I think one of the things that we would see in next five years is the cost of laying the cables. Subsea will go down substantially as the requirement for more bandwidth will go up and the willingness by all these investors into AI would see that this is going to be an issue, but also a point of making money. Because whoever larger player like Microsoft or Google, they need more and more bandwidth because they've got end users across the world who will be using these bandwidth and that more they have end users, more revenue would generate. So naturally they'll buy into these infrastructures and finance these cables. I think the interesting things is to really watch over the technology itself and how it plays out in terms of solving many of these obstacles and security issues. On the other hand, it also means that each country needs to have a very clear idea on how they want AI to be deployed in terms of deployed to their citizens. Previously, we had Twitter and Facebook and all these communication social networks just deployed without government interventions. And it caused huge problems across the world for governments. And I think the governments are a little bit more careful as to how AI will be deployed. But I think on the whole, I think AI will not have the social impact facebook and Twitter had in terms of social unrest. I think it will be more beneficial for the end users well being and productivity and so on. I also believe that they won't affect employment. I think if you look at many countries who benefited from the smartphone and networks across the world, the communication and this intelligence application didn't really replace people's job. It gave more opportunity for them to move into the digital world. I mean, look at India for example. When mobile network was fully deployed, many industries sprung up and India is now a digital nation. I think this would happen with AI where each country would take up on these new technologies and use it to create new jobs. And I don't know what these new jobs are going to be, but I won't be surprised that each nation will come up with very unique technology and deploy it and find out that they can export it to other country just in a second because of the latency reduction and the huge capacity of these networks. I think that is all I have to say. And thank you very much, everybody.

Speaker A:
Thank. Thank you, Tom. Wish you a very successful week in Israel and look forward to seeing you soon. And thanks again to everybody for a very invigorating useful discussion today. So thanks. Have a great week.

Speaker E:
Thank you.

Speaker C:
Thanks. Bye.

Speaker E:
Amazing presentation, Tom. Bye.
