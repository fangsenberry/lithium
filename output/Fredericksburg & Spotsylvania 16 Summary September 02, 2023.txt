- Speaker A and Speaker B begin the conversation by confirming that B is in Israel preparing for a presentation.
- Speaker C intimates that he/she is planning to visit China on the 10th but is still awaiting a visa. The visit will depend on whether the "China side" approves it.
- Speaker A and Speaker B further discuss B's location - near a beach in Israel. It's indicated that B is in Israel for a conference involving the Japanese government and 50 startups from Tel Aviv.
- Speaker B reveals plans to travel to Sri Lanka after his time in Israel, expecting to arrive late evening on a Friday. Speaker A plans to meet him there.
- Speaker C reveals plans to head to Nairobi in a few days, after returning to Anarbo on Tuesday early morning.
- Speaker E mentions autumn season in Sweden, talk about the weather in Norway, and mentions a call with Admiral Inman. They also discuss environmental issues in Norway due to a lot of rain and destroyed goods.
- Speaker E outlines a scandal regarding the Nobel Prize ceremony where the Russian ambassador's invitation led to boycotts by others who were invited. The invite was later revoked due to the controversy.
- A discussion about the conflict in Ukraine intensifies. Speaker E sees it as unfair to leave Ukraine to defend Europe against Russia without anyone else getting involved.
- Speaker A and Speaker C discuss the possible meeting in China. Speaker C states he may have to seek a visa and would take three days.
- Speaker A and Speaker D briefly talk about their respective plans for being in New York the following week.
- Speaker A highlights a new NYU Stern freshman named David Wong from Shanghai.
- Tom Sato is introduced as a guest speaker from Tel Aviv who will give a presentation on AI infrastructure.
- Speaker D, Howard, is acknowledged as having returned from a trip that included Mongolia, Samarkhan, Uzbekistan, and Estonia. 
- Howard mentions meeting with foreign ministers and highlights the diverse immigrant population in Iceland, including Poles and Ukrainians.
- Speaker A and D discussed their recent travels to various destinations and future meetings including Louis Kern and Roberto.
- Tom Sato is currently in Tel Aviv, Israel, where he is part of a Japanese business delegation to meet Israeli startups and talks about AI infrastructure. 
- Sato explains AI's high power and bandwidth requirements require a global infrastructure optimization. 
- The last IT revolution was supported by a mobile infrastructure upgrade, from 3G to 4G and 5G.
- Governments need to invest in their IT infrastructure for the AI revolution that's set to occur in the next decade.
- The presentation focuses on the global submarine, photonic network and data center infrastructure. 
- For the past 20 years, communication lines were mostly single strand, single core fibers delivering around 10 to 30 terabytes per second capacities. These capacities are inadequate for AI's high bandwidth requirements.
- The Japanese, especially NTT, have led developments in optical fiber manufacturing, and Sony and NTT created I One Global Forum with Intel for optical technology standardization.
- The initiative advocates for 100 times more capacity than the current 10 terabytes, extremely low latency, and a move from electrons to photons to improve electrical efficiency.
- NEC subsidiary, NEC OCC, and Sumito Electric achieved a 1.7 petabytes transmission speed capacity between Australia and Japan in an experiment.
- Nvidia's increase in data center revenue, particularly from the advancement of their HDX AI supercomputer, replaced AMD and Intel's previous dominancy in data center operations.
- Nvidia's Gracehopper Superchip uses two chips: a microprocessor CPU and GPU. The microprocessor uses 72 Arm V9 processors, indicating a shift away from Intel and AMD's architectures.
- Future AI applications will primarily run on Nvidia's AGX supercomputers housed in upgraded data centers.
- Countries need to consider upgrading infrastructure, including the implementation of optical fiber infrastructure and figuring out methods of generating substantial electricity for data centers that are environmentally friendly.
- Speaker E summarized Secretary Romando's recent visit to China, highlighting it led to outcomes that favor continued dialogue between countries.
- Speaker H complimented Sato's presentation and shared an anecdote about investing in a data center, QTS, which became extremely valuable due to the rise of AI.
- Many large data centers are looking for methods to generate their own energy due to complications in grid connections.
- The trend of data centers seeking to generate their own power foreshadows future challenges and advances in energy production.
- A significant amount of energy is used up in cooling data centers, leading to innovative approaches such as the construction of data centers in cooler climates like Iceland using geothermal cooling.- Geothermal cooling is predicted to become more widespread, particularly in areas where it can function as a substitute for power.
- New Reality, an AI chip designer in Israel, has partnered with Intel to compete with Nvidia.
- Due to an ongoing decoupling trend, there's an increasing demand for data centers in Asia that are not connected to China.
- There's a trend towards green data centers that generate their own power, often using ammonia or hydrogen.
- Many data centers are being built in less populated areas linked by high-speed networks. Batang is popular for Singapore due to its close proximity.
- There's a push towards decentralized AI that can be used by individuals, highlighting a lack of trust in the system.
- The line between the virtual and real world is blurring as simulations are used to plan real-world implementations.
- Concerns are raised around potential biases in AI, particularly those developed in the West, and the importance of understanding the accuracy of information is emphasized.
- Many data centers are being constructed in Iceland owing to its cool climate and abundant hydropower.
- However, Iceland places a higher value on industries that bring more jobs, such as aluminum plants.
- Other potential data center locations include Bhutan, which has significant hydropower resources.
- Estonia offers an e-citizenship that allows business dealings within the European Union, supported by a well-designed electronic ID system.
- Various countries are securing backup copies of their data outside their national territories to prevent loss during cyber-attacks.
- Opportunities exist for places with cheap power, such as Paraguay, to become data center providers despite not offering cooling advantages.
- In Japan, the Digital Transformation Ministry is promoting the 'My Number Card', similar to a social security number, which can connect to citizens' bank accounts and insurance, and request official documents.
- This trend in Asia and the world shows an increasing demand for digital services amid issues of trust, bias, and the ongoing blending of physical and virtual worlds.- Japan is facing issues with the promotion of My Number Card due to naming issues and errors arising due to civil government staff not being well-versed with using the iPad.
- Concerns about cybersecurity are highlighted and the need to focus more on sea cable security pointed out.
- Conversation shifted to EU's new digital services agreement and a discussion about power generation in France and possible looming issues.
- It is noted that the internet has largely been financed by advertisement and the profitability of changing internet cables and data centres is in doubt due to financial restrictions.
- Concerns are raised that increased IT service costs could reduce the market or make it unavailable in some places.
- The necessity of exploitative exploitation of existing resources is discussed, with Italy only utilizing 8% of national oil and gas sources though capability exists to cover 30-40% of the country's needs.
- Italy's political situation and its potential to interfere with the exploitation of resources is noted, as is the absence of nuclear power since the Chernobyl incident.
- Apparently, 60% of Italians are now in favor of nuclear plants, possibly due to changes in generational attitudes.
- Italy's power needs are an urgent issue, given the lack of nuclear plants and a heavy reliance on hydroelectric power, solar and wind.
- The discussion then shifts to the crises in Africa, specifically uranium and recent coups, and China's influence in the global South through technology and infrastructure development.
- Huawei reportedly mediates 70% of Africa's IT infrastructure connectivity.
- Emerging economies have been pivoting towards China's orbit due to the backing of Chinese financial institutions.
- The recent coups in African countries are characterized as reactions against French influence, seen by many as the cause of poverty and backwardness.
- Countries like Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Guinea and Mali are seen as of particular concern to the West due to their anti-colonial stances.
- Notion that Gabon's coup was "friendly" and more of a measure to pre-empt a more hostile coup.
- Uncertainty persists about what these developments will mean for Africa as a whole, arguing that power dynamics are not really under the control of most African nations.- The next BRICS meeting is to be held in Russia. 
- The plan is to strengthen the alliance with China and Russia leading, particularly focusing on expanding BRICS.
- China and Russia aim to create global changes and push back on the dollar, particularly around the Ukraine war, and assert themselves globally.
- One key discussion point is digitalization; countries in the alliance aim to use technology in trade and commerce using local currencies rather than a universal mediating currency.
- The expectation is a platform possibly using Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) or other tax instruments to facilitate commerce not through the dollar, but their own local currencies.
- Six extra countries are expected to join BRICS early next year. 
- Issues discussed include the United Nations General Assembly, upcoming G20 in India, and BRI Summit in China, and the viewpoint of China towards the Executive Order by the Biden administration.
- China views the EO as the latest in US sanctions against its scientific and technological development and perceives it as a 'cold war' on those frontiers by the US.
- The development of 5G technology by Huawei, despite severe sanctions, is seen as a significant achievement in China.
- Security and other geopolitical issues surrounding Ukraine and Europe are an area of concern.
- The fear of military involvement, both direct and through provision of equipment, hinders support for Ukraine. 
- The topic of undersea cable security was discussed, with its importance being recognized, though practical solutions are still being developed. 
- The political and economic leaders of Japan and US have started to understand the vulnerability and importance of undersea cables, advances have also been made in the US, Japan, and South Korean relationships.
- It is predicted that in the next five years, the cost of laying subsea cables will go down due to an increase in demand for bandwidth and potential profitability in the infrastructure for larger tech companies like Microsoft and Google.- Countries must have a clear strategy on how AI will be deployed for their citizens. 
- Social networks like Twitter and Facebook were deployed without much government intervention, causing widespread problems globally. 
- Governments are now more cautious about how AI technologies will be deployed. 
- AI is not expected to have the same social impact as Facebook and Twitter in terms of causing social unrest. 
- AI benefits end users' well-being and productivity more significantly. 
- AI is not predicted to detrimentally impact employment. 
- Comparatively, intelligent applications and smartphones provided more opportunities for individuals to become part of the digital world, without displacing jobs. 
- Using the example of India, the deployment of mobile networks led to the sprouting of many industries, making India a digital nation. 
- The same effect is expected with AI, with new technologies creating new jobs in countries globally. 
- While the specifics of these new jobs are uncertain, each nation may develop unique technologies, export them to other countries rapidly due to reduced latency and network capacity. 
- Speaker A thanks Tom for his contribution and wishes him a successful week in Israel, while also expressing gratitude to everyone for a useful discussion. Speakers C and E also express their gratitude and bid goodbyes.
