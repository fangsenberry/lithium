Speaker A:
Know about soapbox?

Speaker B:
Well, apparently this one in Tonga, the effects reached the EXO atmosphere, right?

Speaker A:
Yeah.

Speaker B:
And it affected satellites and everything else. And of course in the 19th century that couldn't have been detected. But anyways, it was just a very interesting article. I almost included it, but thought Mel, maybe I better not.

Speaker A:
I'd be happy to read interesting. Well, you know, sometimes a long time ago the movie called After Tomorrow, it's not a nuclear thing, but it is. But they're talking about the Ice age is covering up the northern hemisphere. And then it's moved to the southern hemisphere and wherever they had to move to the equators area to survive. But that was a story disrupted the current under current going warming up northern Atlantic, the warming up of the desalinization by those glaciers and ice cubes and whatnot makes all disruption of those current ecosystem. So environment is changing. So we may are facing sort of a continental scale of the shifting of weather. So the drier place is getting wetter, wet place is getting dry. And mountain like this is like 20 years ago when we built our house, it was so dry I hadn't even put me a humidifier in summer to keep us not too dry. But now I have to have a dehumidiator.

Speaker B:
Dehumidifier?

Speaker A:
Yeah, dehumidifier. So it's over 20 years. This much of difference was just surprise, actually. Very surprising. It's certainly something changing may not be really the global warming because I think we believe we had 50 degrees Celsius always even 30, 40 years ago, somewhere in the world. Like Afghanistan, right? Well, it could be cycle. It also could be human. I mean, we wouldn't really know. For example, that the windmill on the water. So we have a lot of wind farm water. Those wind farms slow down the wind. When they slow down the wind, they slow down the current. And some of them are right now calculating, trying to figure out that is the El Nino and La Nino, because of the wind farm installation, preliminary data indicating there's a relationship. Until they publish, we will know. Or are they allowed to publish? Do you think the solar panels reflecting sunshine might also the effect of the weather pattern? You mean the sun?

Speaker C:
Okay.

Speaker A:
The solar panel. I don't think it affect much, but the solar panel do create a heat envelope between the panel and the ground. So it was kind of like drying up the place as well destroy the grass underneath. So that is one of the issue. That's the reason why that putting the solar panel in the desert is actually preferred. So they can take the heat, but if you do it on the grassland or put it on the water, it will have ecosystem impact. In fact, our experiment in Singapore tell us that below the algae grow a lot faster and that kind of destroy the ecosystem a bit. So I think that is an issue. We have no place to put the panel, so we put it on the water, on the reservoir, so we see the effect. So that project was hot.

Speaker B:
So it heats the water is your point?

Speaker A:
Yes. And the LG and all kind of things that we typically keep the balance. All right. So I think that is one of the issues. And it affected this fish farm nearby Singaporean. Food is more important, but their energy ultimately, I think the major heat source for us, for the warming is sun. All right. If there's enough dust in the air to reflect what's it called, the sunlight, we will cool the temperature down. But that is not beyond within our control because you can put a lot of micro dust up there. But how long will the dust stay okay? Will it stay longer than we want it and then cool down too much? I think that's a question that Geoengineering has to think about. Do you think those dust went up to the really close to the space, might stay up there rotting or eventually coming down? Eventually they will come down. The only question is how long does it take for them to come down? Right. But you bring it up there and detonate dust out there. I think it's not difficult. Current technology can do that. How long does it take for the dust to drop from the stratosphere all the way down back to Earth? We don't know.

Speaker D:
Right.

Speaker A:
If you take 100 years, maybe we cool down too much. Those are the calculations that I think it's better not to attempt it. Do you think this is a difference between the st herons is on the ground in the inside of the interior part of the continent. And when that erupted, and I think that was back in 1981 or something that year, globally, we had a very raw crop, meaning sunlight was really stopped and the winter was really cold. I remember that year we had very heavy snow in Tokyo, which is rare. I remember about one week we shut down in Tokyo area because we couldn't move around. And that never happened since then. And this one is from the middle of the past week. And I thought to be very effective, but it seems like a summer doesn't work. That cooling effect. What's the difference?

Speaker B:
Just to interrupt. Good morning. Peter's gone and he's driving today, so he'll be listening. And he wrote me before, if we have a question for him, he'll answer, but he's driving, so he's peter, I was just explaining everybody, you're driving and listening and we'll comment if needed.

Speaker A:
Yeah. Thanks, Phil.

Speaker D:
I appreciate it.

Speaker A:
I'm going to go on mute next to my wife.

Speaker B:
Understand?

Speaker A:
I'll go on mute, but I'm here.

Speaker E:
Okay.

Speaker B:
Good morning.

Speaker A:
You know what? I'm going to good to just so people don't get all distracted by the movement.

Speaker B:
And maybe if I put it here, we're fine.

Speaker A:
Okay. Is that okay?

Speaker B:
Yeah, that's fine. It's not going to distract us at all.

Speaker D:
Okay, sounds good.

Speaker A:
How are you doing?

Speaker B:
We're fine. We're just chatting about global climatic issues.

Speaker A:
Sadly, and this is incredibly sad, but a friend of mine in Maui who's a firefighter, lost his house, his cars, someone died in his house, we don't know who yet. And he's in the hospital with burns on his face and hands and my guess is he was trying to rescue the person in his house. So it really drives home the horror of that catastrophe.

Speaker B:
Well, the town of Lahaina at least. I know noto and I have been there, but it's incredible.

Speaker E:
How long was your mother?

Speaker B:
Yeah.

Speaker E:
That'S sad.

Speaker B:
Good morning, Alvaro Or. Good afternoon.

Speaker A:
There is no competition today, so I'm happy to join.

Speaker B:
Last week it was raining and now today is just an off day.

Speaker A:
No, it's between two competitions. I finished yesterday, the first one and now on Monday the next one starts.

Speaker B:
How did the first one go?

Speaker A:
I came eight out of 24.

Speaker B:
Wow. Congratulations.

Speaker A:
What was the competition? The Mediterranean. The Southern European Championship for gliding, for safe. Lane. Wow. Congratulations. Thank you. Where does it take place in Rieti? It is north, about 80 km north. Rome.

Speaker E:
Wow.

Speaker A:
Yeah. I have a lot of glider time and a lot of aerobatic glider time and then I crashed and that kind of put a damper on my soaring experience. But I walked away. That's a good thing when you walk away, I guess. Very much so. How are you all? I see smiling faces.

Speaker B:
Fine. We have Alex and Fangi in Singapore and Oto in Japan. And Peter is driving someplace in New York, I think.

Speaker A:
Upstate New York. Driving back to New York City. It's about a four hour drive. Okay. City here is up and the mountain up here is cool. Right now outside is 18 degree bill. I'm going to go on mute just in the car. Sure.

Speaker B:
Great. Yeah. Admiral Miller is out in Hawaii. He texted me. He hopes you understand. It's two in the morning out there, so he won't be on the call tonight.

Speaker A:
Is he on the oahu?

Speaker B:
Yeah, he's in Oahu. He took two of his grandchildren out there for just a quick holiday, which was nice.

Speaker A:
He doesn't visit the park.

Speaker B:
He what?

Speaker A:
He's not going to go to the park to see old time sake?

Speaker B:
Oh, I'm sure people will come and see him and he'll talk about that later.

Speaker A:
Have we heard anything from Howard on his voyage?

Speaker B:
Well, just what he texted all of us, and that is that he and Jasper had a nice meeting in Kyoto, but I think this weekend is when he arrives in Ulambator? I think so.

Speaker A:
That should be fascinating.

Speaker B:
Angelo, good afternoon. Yeah, I'm sure Howard will check in when he can, but in Mongolia? I know he's way up in the grassland area someplace.

Speaker A:
I read this week about how the Chinese dominating all those rare material was fascinating. I don't think we got a report like that in Japan. I just tried to Google it, and I couldn't find any Japanese language budget. Yeah, it's actually a really significant issue. And the largest repository of rare earth metals on the planet is in Afghanistan, and the Chinese are already negotiating with the Taliban to extract rare earth metals in Afghanistan.

Speaker B:
We built a lot of the roads, too, that lead to that area.

Speaker A:
Exactly. But the rare earth metal is one of those choke points, particularly in semiconductor.

Speaker D:
Production.

Speaker A:
And computer production, that will turn out to be a strategic weapon. And in the US. I was an investor in a rare earth mining company. But the reality of it is that the environmental restrictions in the US. Are so strict and the rare earth mining is so environmentally destructive that there really have been very few. I think there's one mine left in Nevada, but other than that, the US. Has pretty much shut down all of its so in in deference to environmental concerns. But you still have a reserve that you said say again, does US have a reserve for the Rayas materials if you have to? I don't know. Yeah, I don't know the answer to that question. It's a really good question. I have no idea. The rare earth metal company that I'm an investor in is located in Canada, but I invested because I figured there aren't that many and see what happens.

Speaker B:
I remember Howard has brought up to us a couple of times that he's an investor in a company that focuses on that, but maybe he can address that in a couple of weeks when he's back.

Speaker A:
Yeah, I'm about to make an investment. I talked about it last week.

Speaker B:
Yelena, welcome back.

Speaker A:
I'm about to make an investment in that.

Speaker F:
Thank you.

Speaker A:
I'm about to make an investment in that room pilot and car company.

Speaker B:
And of course, uranium is big in the news right now, and apparently some of the reserves in the US. Are now being blocked off. So we'll see.

Speaker A:
Also in a chat group, I think Lewis posted talking about the nuclear power plant development cost china versus the United States $25 billion per gigawatt versus $2 billion per gigawatt. How we got to have to think like that, how we deal with I'm just surprised.

Speaker B:
Well, the nuclear we've known the plans of Chinese commercial nuclear power for some time, so the fact that this is just being coming out now, I find surprising. This has been known for some time. They are going full speed ahead on developing a commercial nuclear power.

Speaker A:
The question is, are they building the power plant safe? We had the safety standard that's very high, but we had a disaster happening in Kushima. That's the big question. Yeah, I don't think it's a question. I think you can assume they're unsafe.

Speaker B:
Why don't we get started? And Al, since you're on and it looks like you're wide awake out there in Utah and we exchanged emails this week, if you don't mind. Al, if you could just on reflection of last week, if you could just share a few thoughts to start out.

Speaker F:
With.

Speaker D:
On the question of what on.

Speaker B:
The question that we were last week, which is really more the societal and social aspects going on in China right now anyways, or anything that you think appropriate. Because clearly the Rio stat is going towards the higher side on the overall China issue right now, which Lewis will get into as well. But anyways, Al, I just thought from your email, if you might want to reflect a few points.

Speaker D:
All right. Recently, I was fortunate enough to spend two weeks in China, largely outside of Beijing and Shanghai and the interior, following a former business partner around as he was pursuing his business activities. My purpose in doing that was as a national security specialist, just to get a sense of what was going on in the public itself. How were the Chinese people responding to the world's events? The things that impressed me were one. Having spent the better part of 60 years observing what goes on in China, as a national security specialist for the Department of Defense, I was impressed with the presence of the Party. Having worked in China for a number of years after I retired from the military in my own business, I was very sensitive to the presence of the Party. But never have before had I seen it so apparent publicly, with symbols of the Party present on public buildings and in the offices where I visited. Heretofore, the Party had largely operated in the background, out of the view of the foreign public, if you would, and out of view of many of the Chinese. But even though it was a celebration of the Party's anniversary at that time, the signs that I saw were permanent. They were in the business rooms on the wall, very prevalent. And the Party officials were clearly the decision maker. The professional people in government were those who supported, gave information to, explored what was to be needed in a particular policy decision. But it all led up to the Party where the Party decision was made. The degree of professionalism of the Party was such that I hadn't seen before. Absolutely no drinking, no smoking, et cetera, in business meetings. That's not the type of meeting that I had seen and participated in. Party officials were very conscious that they had a report card that was being made out on them, on every decision that they made. Now, recently I read another person's criticism of the system. It says that the Party officials are reluctant to make decisions. I didn't find that to be the case. I found them to be very cautious about the decisions they made, aware that they were going to be held accountable for their decisions. And while I'm not a particular, in fact I'm a rather avid non enthusiast about communism as a structure, you have to be impressed when a system imposes a degree of discipline on decision making, does it mean all decisions are timely and on the right ones? Obviously not. I did witness a certain amount of destruction in Chongqing as a result of the flooding that went on during that period of time. It was devastating. Number of people were killed in the process. And as one environmental scientist of Chinese origin pointed out, there's an awful lot of that destruction going on in China today and will ultimately come back to haunt the party for decisions they've made yet. On the other hand, the environmental decisions that I had seen the party make were impressive. They far exceeded the degree of environmental consciousness that I'm aware of here in the United States, and I get a chance to travel around the United States fair amount. The degree of emphasis on electrical vehicles was very impressive. Tesla has a mighty competitor in BYD. BYD is producing half a million plus vehicles a month. And Tesla is not just barely over 400,000 a month. BYD is reluctant into the United States market, probably for very good reasons, but it's definitely capturing the market in a lot of other places. The time and effort that has been spent over the years by the party in education is bearing fruit. Given the large number of people in the technology sector and the emphasis on AI and all of the other things that are important in technology today, china is definitely coming to the foreground. I would not be willing to put just based on two weeks of walking around and observing any kind of evaluation on who's who in terms of leadership in any one area, but I would definitely say that the infrastructure of China is very impressive. Whether it be transportation, whether it be communications across the board, the amount of investment in infrastructure is impressive. And the people that are being brought into the system. I also talked to a fair number of people who were disillusioned by being left out of the process that's going on. I don't know of any country that doesn't have those kind of problems. I've been impressed with the Chinese leadership's ability to recognize and begin to turn in directions to carry out change, to accommodate whether shortcomings in the system. The my impression is based on 50 years of walking around in the past and adding these two weeks on top of it. So I don't take it lightly that we have a formidable competitor and international system. And it's no small wonder that when Third World countries go to visit China, that they're mightily impressed with what's going on. However, I did find also the same thing I have found in the past, that maintenance is terrible. If you're an engineer and you build something, you need to make sure that you have some sense of how to maintain it over time, and that's still a problem in China. But then again, when I turn around and look at the United States, at the very poor way that we have maintained some of our infrastructure over time in terms of maintenance, it's easy to understand why people are reluctant to invest in trying to maintain things. Education is on the rise. Education is very competitive. Taiwanese that I have known for many years find that their children, their grandchildren, are going to turn to China for education rather than try to compete in a foreign language abroad in other parts of the world. It does not mean that Taiwanese don't appreciate the opportunities they have abroad, but it is really easy to have an advanced education in your own language. So I found young people in the interior of China, in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guangxi Guang and so on, from Taiwan. It is commonly known some 10% of the Taiwanese working population is in China. There is rightfully some concern in Taiwan of the integration of their society with that in China, that it may lead in the future to changes that a large part of the Taiwan population does not desire, that is, integration. But it's a working reality among the young people that they can find opportunities in China that they cannot find in Taiwan and they cannot find broad elsewhere. So there's a dynamism, there's a change going on in that part of the world that in my mind is very impressive, very interesting, and will change the future of the United States role in the Pacific as time goes on. I don't think I have much more to add to that. To say that I'm impressed with change, not necessarily with how it's being brought about, has little to do with what I see on the daily basis in terms of military competition that the United States must face. Thank you, Phil, for the opportunity.

Speaker B:
Thank you very much, Al. So in that context, data and the Chinese accumulation of credible troves of data and the management and application of that. So this week we have the EO coming out of the President of the United States, really on investment in the technical areas, and then we have the Nvidia buy. So, Alex, following on with Al here, if you could give us some interpretation from your perspective. And then just so everybody's aware, the sequencing in China is july is the month when the party committees meet and give their reports. August is the month when the families and the leadership assemble at the beach area, which Al and I are both familiar with. We've both been there. And then September, likely September. October is the plenum of the Central Committee. So that's the sequencing. So we have yet to see the plenum coming. But there are indicators just this week coming out of the beach when the top AI and superconnectivity experts of China were brought to the beach to meet with the leadership. And I think as I noted to most people, even though technically she convened it, the center of the photo that was shot with the experts was a gentleman named Qi. If there is a number two in China, this is my opinion. I was criticized earlier this week for not giving my opinion. So now I will give it. If there's a number two in China, it's Sai chi. So it's a name that people should get to know. So Alex, if you want to follow on with that, I appreciate.

Speaker F:
Thanks.

Speaker A:
Thanks Phil. I think the whole process right now is getting very complex and opaque as what Phil has mentioned, that there's a sequence of events that happen in China and typically that is a process they are going. Now. The first thing that Phil mentioned about the large amount of data that China has accumulated largely also from all the transaction plus all the geo data, plus people and also genomic data. So all these data are now sitting somewhere and somebody are working on them. Now all this data will not be shared for very simple reason as they will always claim that this will be national security reason. Now it is not wrong for anybody to think about that this way, especially genomic data, because it will be sufficient information. You can engineer bio, what's I call weapon to target a particular group of people. So the concern is always there. This is not new. Previously only the leader are concerned about it. This is why you see that whenever they go, they will bring their own water. And this North Korea's, what's it called leader even bring his own toilet bowl in that sense that there's a known concern about it. But this whole thing right now that with the ability of technology you can target a large group of people. People begin to be very concerned about even the populace data. So starting from there, we start looking at a lot of data that coming out of China that is not painting a very clear picture. Why do we say that is that I think Luis has shared a lot of information about China current situations. But we are also seeing that China do have quite a number of plans and they can activate, but they don't seems to be eager to do that. So the articles that Fuse shared in this financial time about meeting frankly, I would just say that the financial time has probably lost its information source. There isn't any good or credible information. It's all about speculation about what China as well as Xi JP could be worrying about. But there isn't any facts on there other than the picture or the pre meeting that Phil mentioned. The scientist meeting up with Tai Chi. Tai Chi is very unique person and he has been around for a very long time. He's known to help quite a lot of policy, meeting up with the scientists, the top scientists on these two areas basically indicate that this is very clear the next area they will focus on. But it is also not surprising that we know that these two areas can be very critical and important to China. For superconductor, I think the usage will likely be on the energy part. Previously Mr. Gao mentioned that. So on the energy part that you're looking at this with some what's it called anticipation, that hopefully that will help to reduce the cost for number one, transportation and also that number two on the UK reactor. I think just now we are talking about nuclear reactor and how cheap the Chinese can be. But the key important thing is that for the economy to continue to have growth, energy is what is needed and constantly required to have those energy, right? So that's one part of it. The other part is about AI. I think AI is on the uptrend and everybody is right now rushing into focusing on AI. We have constantly only see the western development. Almost all the model we are seeing are usually the western model with open AI share GPT leading the pack with all the regulations and regulation discussion, everything down there. But we hardly hear anything about the Chinese AI other than some of them. Most people view it as a copycat. But the reality is that China has its own AI institution bai, where they develop the base model called Utah. Utah has been going into the version three right now and it is training with a much larger I would say that the parameters compared to everybody. Now, the interesting thing about parameter where Fangi previously shared is that earlier when people training AI model, the data is restricted because you have to scrub and clean the data. So getting a large amount of data is not easy, but eventually with everybody cleaning up so we do have a large amount of data and training with more parameter. Once the parameter reached a critical point beyond that become a large model, the system being trained all of a sudden that you become more intelligent. Exactly why and how it happened you probably do not know, but that is a phenomena and that is the reason for GPT-2 into three. You see that breakthrough. Now imagine that Utah is ten times more parameter than the GPT-3. We are not able to see a lot, a lot of what's it called applications and auditing. Largely it's also because what Bai claimed is that there isn't enough processing power about that. So it is not surprise that we see all of a sudden that everybody start buying the AI card from Nvidia. That is a very natural one, but we probably already seen it one quarter ago when Nvidia all of sudden a mentioned that they have a fantastic quarter. But we did notice that the number doesn't pan out because the total demand is much less than what the Nvidia has sold, which also means that those could have been purchased by China company last quarter. Instead of you just hear it right now. Probably right now it's about taking delivery now. So what we are seeing is that there is a lot of things going on, but it is not very visible for us to make much assessment data. A large group of data eventually will be used to train the AI and they can do a lot more things. That is something that we are not able to project to understand what could be happening. So that's number one. Number two is that a lot of technology that China is developing and they are developing quietly, nothing wrong with that. But of course we want to have some visibility to know what direction they are going and how they apply that. I think that is also another concern. The third one is about the economy. The economy is that everybody is hoping that China is going to be the next engine, which I think the World Bank and everybody, china going to be the next engine, but they don't seems to be willing to be the engine at the moment. So I will stop here. There's a lot of things for us to process and digest, but I think I would like to hear everybody's opinion about how China is developing. Thank you. Back to you, Phil.

Speaker B:
Thank you. Yelena. If you don't mind, if I could just ask you, there was an article that I just posted this morning on biodata and how in fact China is also the incredible trove of biodata. And taking into account what Alex just said, are there any comments you'd like to make at this point?

Speaker F:
Hi, it's great to be back and to see everyone. So with biodata, I'm not sure yet. Alex mentioned how this could be misused and used against particular groups or individuals targeting them. Kind of the precision medicine model applied to individuals. So there's good reason to kind of protect one's genomic material. But in terms of how they're looking at in China, I don't know. I hope to actually learn in the coming year as I'm about to leave for my sabbatical, first to Turkey and then to Singapore and just sort know, try to figure out how people imagine and what the capabilities actually will be. There's a lot of people in the scientific community who sort of question whether or not you can really weaponize the data. So there's a lot of skepticism about this too. I don't want to say that inevitably we're going to see these genetic weapons and so all these data that China has could be used against us. It's still something to determine. So capabilities and intentions still very unclear. I did spend a week, just came back recently from a nuclear boot camp. So I can give some thoughts on just generally on weapons of mass destruction. So I was invited. To this boot camp which took place in Sandia National Laboratories. This is one of the three laboratories of U. S. Department of Energy. The other one is Los Alamos and then Lawrence Livermore, which are kind of just was curious to sort of see know we have approached the nuclear question over the past many decades and how that has evolved. And I was really surprised to learn how. We really have no idea. I mean, this kind of echoing what's happening now with AI. There's a high extent of things. We just don't know how it works, how deterrence is working, for example. So in the we developed all these really nice models about how deterrence will work and how we can prevent each other from going to war by each other. I mean, at the time, United States and Soviet Union and then there was another wave of empirical studies where they sort of tested some of these ideas, which it's hard to do because we only had two bombs dropped. And so there's not too many, thank God, actual empirics to study from. But there were tests and studies have shown that all of these theories of deterrence that have been developed, these ideas, frameworks just don't work. It's sometimes literally the opposite. So, for example, one study found that having nuclear weapons probably aggravated the Cold War conflict. And so we didn't see that nuclear confrontation between Soviet Union and US. But we did see a lot of other types of conflict playing out in the Third World, especially, again, the opposite effect, potentially. And now we're in the cusp of something, a big transformation. It was mentioned that China is rising up as a peer competitor. And so now there's a lot of talk about what's called a three body problem or two peer problem with China entering the equation. The equation before was somewhat know you had two peers, nuclear peers. And again, like I said, the models we have, they're quite imperfect in terms of predicting their behavior. And now when you have that third actor, that third body, suddenly we have no idea how to manage that. For those who read the book The Three Body Problem, you might remember how difficult that one was to solve. So we're on that verge of having to deal with it, and we don't know how we're going to do that. And it comes at a time when the three countries are not communicating. The arms control regime, the arms control agreements have collapsed. United States withdrew. Russia just withdrew as well from the new Star Treaty after what happened with Ukraine. So we're at a point where US. Russia and China have to communicate, and they're not. So we had people from State Department and various agencies come in to talk to us, and they're saying even the words that we use in the United States and in China are different. The word for the terms in China apparently I have no idea they have sort of different words to think about it. So we're not on the same page conceptually potentially about nuclear weapons. And then there is a book which was recommended to me by Dima Dansky that talks about how in Russia there's this fusion with the Greek Orthodox Church. So between religion and the nuclear community, which is to me, just mind boggling. So Russia is spinning in a different direction potentially with the way it thinks about nuclear. So again, so we're in the cusp of this time where Russia, US, China might be thinking very differently about nuclear weapons. We have no idea and we're not talking to each other. There's no arms control regime anymore to speak of. People say it's dead. Some other people say, well, it's just ebbs and flows. We're at the ebb point. And so now the people that presented to us, they're saying at least we can build some norms around this whole thing. And then the question is, how do you build norms when you don't really communicate? So I mentioned the three body problem. The other big challenge is the emerging technologies in space talked about AI, cyber warfare, supersonic weapons. So there are all these things added, more things added to the equation, making everything even more complicated, adding more uncertainty. And I mean, just to be honest, nobody has any idea. This is why they brought us together, trying to figure it out. We did war gaming and simulations and they're basically like solve these problems for us. And we did not. I started an article where I'm thinking through this and just making an argument, which is to even begin to build norms getting together and kind of have more academic discussions which might sound boring, but just on basic concepts like what are the words that we use to think about our nuclear power? What are some frameworks, how does nuclear power work politically? And so I think just having sort of academic conversations would be a really great start. So that's something I want to argue for in an article which I hope to write with a colleague in Russia and publish maybe in China. That's my aspiration as I develop this idea for how to get conversation going at the academic level, my goal was, okay, so lessons from nuclear to genetic or biotechnological. So I'm still thinking it through. But again, the big lesson is like, we just don't know what we're doing in general with things. Technology sort of has its own logic. It's driving things. Policy kind of tries to keep up, but even that is lagging. There's an ability to come to consensus or even just basic dialogue about these things at this point at the global level. So that's breaking down any ability that humans had, which is so limited to influence things and the development of technologies and the use is so limited. Of course, you also have in the chat the role of corporations and how they can make these quick decisions to stop protein folding investments and that could have big implications. What role do these large corporations play? Do they have some agency and decision making? I'm not sure. But in the world of these complex systems, one being built on top of another, there's a sense of it's hard to predict much. So I'll stop here. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Elena, and great to have you back. Your concept of bootcamp is very interesting and I think grabbed all of our attention. Peter Bloom is driving and I've invited him to comment at any time because when I call him may not be the best time, but Peter, you know you can chime in at any point.

Speaker A:
Yeah. Thanks, Bill. I'm on kind of a curvy road. So for now, I appreciate that very much, but for now I think I'd be safer. Just stay on mute, please.

Speaker B:
That's fine, but just know you can interrupt at any.

Speaker A:
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

Speaker B:
Angelo, if you don't mind just hearing what you've heard and from a European perspective, when you hear that deterrence has really come apart is effectively what Yelena just said, what does that bring you to consider where we are right now?

Speaker D:
Well, the problem you say from a European point of view I don't know. I don't believe there is a European point of view. I mean, on all of the issues, Europe is completely divided. Germans have their agenda. French, they have their agenda. I don't know if Italy has its own agenda. We are trying to survive amongst the general. De Gaulle many years ago, say that Europe is made by France and Germany. The rest are just a salad you put around your meal. And unfortunately, this is what happens.

Speaker A:
All happily.

Speaker D:
I don't know. So frankly speaking, I went over this European procedure on all these issues. It showed that Germany is probably the country is the most difficult situation now because it's so strictly linked to China and it was still strictly linked to Russia. They are deciding every day what they have to do. The reflex is just a very weak government. The weakest government in Europe. Probably even weaker than the French government. So I had several reflections about what was said, even if it is not my field. But really I could not collate a European point of view, a European reaction. That is my feeling.

Speaker A:
Thank you.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Angelo. Jason, if you don't mind if I ask you because Yelena brought up an interesting aspect which I know you've been I mean, you're teaching English in Russia, but also you're observing and you've been observing the church and the state in the last couple years and you've made some comments on that. Just following on with what Yelena said. If you could share with us some of the idiosyncrasies that you've observed. Thank you.

Speaker G:
I should really spend more time actually going to Russian Orthodox churches. Dmitri and I are talking about this, and we're both aspiring to find some Orthodox priests who would be willing to communicate with us and share their ideas. I guess you have to put your or try to put yourself in their shoes conceptually. Imagine that you are a devout person who lived under the Soviet system and its aftermath, and you ask your question, why did God give us nuclear weapons, not the Germans? And in that case, you begin to understand nuclear weapons as being the moral burden that Russians must bear. And I, in my own reading of Russian news, gathered that the majority of Russian analysts and experts are very much averse to the notion that Russia would ever use them, especially in this conflict in the Ukraine. However, RT did carry one article about a month ago by an analyst whose name I forget who, threw out the presupposition that maybe Russia will need to resort to a preemptive nuclear strike on the west. And his justification for this was that elites in the United States, in his words, have lost all sense of self preservation. That rather than focusing on America's domestic concerns and America's own domestic interests, they are engaging in adventurism on a global scale that is a very real threat to the world. And if push comes to shove, that Russia might have to bear the burden of being the evildoers who put an end to it by launching a nuclear weapon at the United States. And of course, this created an outcry. And a group of Russian academicians responded to this by saying, that's insane, and any kind of nuclear exchange will be the end for humanity. So we shouldn't even go there. I just thought it was very interesting that RT would even carry such an article. Other than that, I don't know what else to report. If anybody has any questions but Jason.

Speaker B:
If you could just add I mean, I think you've said it's weekly, but weekly on national TV, the Metropolitan or one of the chief priests is on TV. And what is the flow of that? And for instance, during the Pragogian affair, the situation, it was The Metropolitan that came on TV, and that really doesn't get reported in the west. So you might want to make a comment on that.

Speaker G:
I'm writing a paper right now. I've already written several about what I describe as the church state in Russia, the party state in China, and what I'm tentatively calling the TV state in the west. As I mentioned before, my thesis is that Russia re emerged, reconfigured, and reconstructed itself after the demise of the Soviet Union along the lines of a church state. Not a theocracy, but a system that, much like the two headed eagle of the Russian coat of arms, balances the prerogatives of the church and the state. And the church is responsible for spiritual nourishment and spiritual guidance of society. Even the Chinese Communists are talking about spiritual civilization now. So this is something real. And the state is responsible for administrative, economic and military affairs. Sometimes the separation is stark, but other times there are these strange crossovers, like Yelena's observation that Russia's nuclear stockpile is blessed by Orthodox priests. Why are they doing that? And another example that you just mentioned is that every Sunday on state television, the content is centered on the church. That includes documentaries that carry church oriented content. And it also includes these interviews not with Patriarch Curl, but with people who occupy high positions in the church. And the interviewer simply asks questions that we might ask, like why did the Soviet Union really break up? And what are some of the problems with AI? I tried to listen and honed my Russian listening skills when it comes to AI. I remember the church says we're not against technological development, but we need to remember the human factor, that you can't abandon pensioners and people who don't know how to use computers by automating everything like Gosuki, the administrative portal that Russians have to use. It's very confusing for older people. This last week, the interviewer asked the priest, what ideology does Russia need today? And his response was first to suggest that although the atheist regime of the Soviet Union was a totalitarian system, that Western liberalism has also mutated into a new kind of totalitarianism. And his response is simply that Russia needs to embrace Orthodox conservatism. So that's something else to explore. What does he mean by Orthodox conservatism? I'm sure Dimitri would have many other things to say about Russia.

Speaker B:
Dimitri, do you have any follow on comment you'd like to offer today?

Speaker A:
Hello, dear colleagues. Yeah, probably I can say something talking about nuclear. I just thought today about this topic, and I read this article from.

Speaker E:
I.

Speaker A:
Guess about Russia he sent us. So there was paragraph in this article about red lines, and he presented these red lines of Russia like something, I don't know, kind of funny, let's say, because Russian government for many times talked about these red lines, and it looked like the Russian government was weak and did nothing about that. But after all, we can see what happens, right? Like NATO expansion, no response from Russian side military drills in Europe also only talks about red lines. But after all, sometime after that, so we can see what happened, the war started. And my idea that we shouldn't underestimate these red lines because personally, I don't think that this nuclear threat is so little, let's say. And one more thing. Recently, I don't know, yesterday or day before yesterday, Shaigu visited Arctic forces and you could read this information from Russian newspapers, and they also add this fact that this area was used to test a nuclear weapon, by the way. And yeah, talking about this topic, I would say that of course, the further escalation is really dangerous for the whole world. And considering that, I think that it is really important what is going on around Nigeria in Africa, because we can see that there are several countries who rise against the west and of course it's complicated and all countries are watching on that. And we can see some bebeble standards like military poo in Ukraine is good and military poo in New Jerusalem is bad for some reason and we cannot see some clear, understandable explanation for that. And I think that there are a lot of societies, if I can say so, who which can understand the idea and which want to have some smooth explanation, smooth understanding. And talking about this church state as Jason presents Russia just now, I was thinking the following, like probably for me, okay, I'm a Russian citizen and I don't feel personally that we have such a tremendous church influence on us. And I wouldn't consider Russians as church people majority. But at the same time, I think that probably the government decided to make a little bit to enhance the system, to make it better. Like during the Soviet time, you couldn't use religion and people who needed some answers, they didn't have them. And that's why it caused frustration among people. And right now I think that it is a way to provide some answers for people. People who are not religious, they can take these ideas, like these Western countries who wanted to conquer Russia. Okay, of course it's not the real words, but I want to show it, radically maximize it. But at the same time we have some church people, of course, indeed. And for these people, somebody should provide the answers. And right now the government just enhanced the system and right now these people can have their answers and they are happy with them, probably at least they don't have this lack of information. This is the idea I just had during Jason's speech and yeah, talking about, I don't know, one more idea about Russia, talking about Russian ruble rate. You know that right now we have a weak ruble. It is 100 rubles for one dollars. It's really bad for Russian people. But yesterday I had a conversation with my friend and he said because for me this situation looks of course it looks bad, like our economy is not doing well. It looks like this. But my friend showed me the situation from some other angle. He said, okay, look at this. When this invasion of Ukraine started and we had this like one dollars equals 120 rubles or so, our government did a lot of things to change that, to help people to live over. But right now, seems the Russian government doesn't want to do a lot for that. And he said, look, why? Because the situation in Russia is more or less stable. And the government decided, okay, if the situation is stable, then we can have some benefits from the situation. Because for Russian government, it is really good to have this ruble because for export they have more and more money and all downsides are more for ordinary people. This is the idea. And it could shows us that the Russian government estimates the situation as stable, especially that we have a lot of attacks, drone attacks from the Ukrainian side. And since for Ukraine it has the opposite effect because it doesn't have any tremendous any big damages. But for ordinary people who couldn't decide, who couldn't understand their own position on that right now, they can think like, okay, no mercy. So it is like terrorist attack on the Crimea bridge or something. And I don't think that it is good for Ukraine. It's more for I don't know, it's rather good for Russian government to explain some crackdowns or to explain this tight policy. I guess. That's all from my thank you very much.

Speaker B:
Dimitri. Victor, you and I talked the previous week, and I know you want to have more time to share your overall thoughts, but since Jason raised this issue of orthodox conservatives, if you could just give us a short thought on that, I think it'd be appreciated at this point, because it's much larger than Russia.

Speaker A:
Yeah.

Speaker C:
As I listened to Jason and Dimitri's presentation, my thoughts brought me back to the behavior, so to speak, of the leader of the rather the leaders of the Orthodox Church in Russia during the First World War, when the then young Bishop Alexey Wan, who becomes the patriarch in 1943 and continues in that position a patriarch of the Russian orthodox Church until 1971. So the young Bishop Alexi, one Alexi, who was consecrated by Nicholas the Char Nicholas and the patriarch of Antioch in 1913, he, during the second the First World War went around the battlefields together with the Serena Alexandra and boosted the morale of the Russian tsarist troops. During the war, he did the same thing, the same man as patriarch. This time in the Second World War, he went around representing his people as he was made the patriarch by Stalin and boosted the morale of the Russian troops against the Nazi occupation. For some reason I put together these elements in the present behavior of patriarchal and so many Russian Orthodox metropolitans and so on. So there is this continuity. The Russian Orthodox Church is an expression of the people, the way they perceive it, and the leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church are the expression of that large mystic identity that they recognize themselves. This is the way I would see it. Thank you.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Victor. And at some future time, Victor is going to talk with us a little bit about the conservative elements growing in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe as well. But we'll leave that for another day because I know you want more time to think that through, Victor, so thank you very much. Elvaro, you made some comments in the chat and I'm sure that a lot of this conversation, somewhat unexpected, today has you thinking quite deeply. If you might want to share a few thoughts with us. Thank you.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Phil. What came to my mind at the beginning of the conversation was when speaking about the red light, and I think I already commented here, but it's always good to remember we already had a nuclear war going on. It was not declared. We had tested 635 nuclear devices in the atmosphere, if I remember where the number. And today there is almost no trace of this. So the dam that protects us against the use of nuclear weapons is very thin. It's based on the large propaganda of the mutual assured destruction and all these theories. But the first that's going to begin to use it will open a stampede and it's going to be unpleasant. And from that viewpoint, having some spiritual, I would say firewalls, that think how this should or should not be used is, for me at least, very consoling. I think that it is very good that I think it was Jason who said that the Church had expressed some very precise limits on moral application of devices and so on, but I think we're living on the razor's edge on that one. Very much so, and very fearful.

Speaker B:
Thank you. Elvaro and Cam Dimitri raised the issue of the focus, obviously, on Africa, which has a nuclear element to it as well, because of the uranium. A lot going on just in the past week, but if you'd like to update and share some thoughts, appreciate it. Thank you.

Speaker E:
Okay, thank you. I don't have good lighting here, so I'm sorry. You can see my face very clearly. But yes, there's plenty of.

Speaker A:
There'S a.

Speaker E:
Mixture of both africa's own ethnic problems, africa's own colonial past, africa's own interaction with the outside world that's playing on this Niger conflict. I think if you have seen the map of Africa that suggests the Sahel belt is what is undergoing many coup d'etas and they're being lumped as the difficult zone on the continent now. But those cousins are different. Again, there's a reason why the one in Niger is attracting so much of attention. Niger, again, is the bullseye of the demographic growth in Africa. Highest fertility rate on the globe is Niger. And I think some time ago, someone has explained that poverty, those of the lower economic class, is where you find highest fertility. Indonesia is about the know, top two, three poorest country in the world. So the Kuritai in Mali, the COUH in guinea and Burkina Faso, they are radical as well, but didn't attract such attention and reaction from Washington and Paris. The Cou durita in Charles was one of quite a different ilk that was actually done by France itself. Mentioned that the current president, his dad died during the civil war, not the war front. And I'll give you another anecdote. There's a video that I have a copy of that the current president of niger, his father, while he was alive, just before he died, he mentioned that when his term of office ran out, two terms, electoral process ran out. He didn't campaign. He just started in his home and the French called him and said, you can leave, you must stay. He didn't want to. And the French, through their different mechanisms in the country, the controlling levels of power and influence, simply walked from Paris, simply walked the parliament to change the constitution and for the President to stay at risk of his own death. And so the French actually changed the constitution for him. He said he didn't want to. He complained. He said Chad has gone through a lot of problems in his history since independence. Him as Debbie. His name was Idris. Debbie. He has lost Polygamous, so his dad had a lot of children. He has lost 17 brothers on the war in charge. And he didn't want to be the next one to die. He didn't want to keep losing such many family members. But lo and behold, he was forced to stay in office. That was a pure coup d'ritta at the French day position of coup through parliament. So that President eventually again found himself at the front of the civil war battle and he got killed. There are suspicions actually that he was killed as soon as he got killed. President Macron left Paris for Chard within three days, just stopped by, changed the parliamentary process for replacing the President and imposed the President's son so that could retain child was purely a French machination. And that's how it's done. Across the argument has been made that many of the constitutional changes in African countries where leaders at the end of their tenure, be it one term or two terms, like the US or three terms, wherever it is they machine it, change the position to stay in power forever. Those are the few councils that Africans are decrimined, not the one that is invalid, because these ones are done, quote unquote, under democratic processes and across the board, all of them, the French has their hands in there. And so the idea that the whole of the Sahel is undergoing coup tasks that the west doesn't like, it's really not accurate. These particular ones that are attracting so much reaction is because the character of the leadership of the coup plotters is very anti French and anti west. And so it threatens the resource grip of the west in those countries and the source of their economic raw material. Now, they've tried to use their proxies in ECOWAS. ECOWAS is the West African community of leaders to undo the coup in Niger in particular. But Nigeria being the most powerful. I had suggested that I could do a more thorough remark on this. The word Nigeria and the word Niger come from the same route. Niger. There's a river that goes from Niger through Nigeria to the Atlantic. So they are both named after the same river. They are neighbors. That means colonial boundaries, just means a line on the sand between the same people. So Nigerians and Nigerians are pretty much the same people on the northern part of Nigeria, on the southern part of Nigeria. When you've heard about instability in Sahel and the Boko Haram and the terrorist activity there, they are the housers who stride the border between Nigeria and Nigeria. They are the same people. So when Nigeria tried to step forward to lead the reversal of the Kurita, they themselves found a very strong domestic backlash. It's the same people. It's like asking your brothers to fight your brothers across an artificial boundary. So Nigeria found itself unable to follow through. And this is the pure thing about an elite system that responds to outside pressure against its own people. And that's what Nigeria tried to do. Many of the West African countries that were pressured to be proxies to fight Niger back, at first instinct, they went along with the pressure, as usual, from France. But then their own people refused because a conflict will just exacerbate what we already know as poverty and dysfunctional, migration, terrorism, or what you want to say is suggested. It could very well be called Africa's own First World War because all of the West Africa will be involved. Do they really want to do that and destabilize the whole area much worse because they want to protect French interest? That's what Africans are asking themselves is the question. The instability in West Africa already is due to French activity in Libya that killed Gaddafi and destabilized the whole structure and stability and pushed weapons and nefarious activities down south. So all of West Africa is already suffering from the impact of French action and NATO action in Libya. And now again, the one one. So West Africa is resisting this. All in all, this is like a moment where Africa is feeling itself. When we've talked about the youth bulge and demographic shift, we may well see these Nigerian West African pools as the first implications of this youthful burge. The guys who run, who made the pool, it has they were born after 1980. They were born one of them was born when I was in high school. They're very young folks. And so this is what it means for Africa to be youthful. And increasingly so means there's a generation that is detached from the older folks of the colonial area era or immediate post colonial era who are asking different questions, who have not much to gain in the world that they have very little stakes in, and they are willing to put everything on the line and say things have to change. So for me, the concern would not so much be that the source of Western economic raw materials are being threatened in West Africa and the so called global order is being threatened. But it should give indication to the west and. If I may say it, to Europeans and their descendants, that the model of the last 400 years, as Africa gets moral, demographic power, these are the things that would arise. A rejection of the overall global structure, maybe. The countries may not be as strong as China and India to be cohesively powerful with one system. They may be very weak. But Africa's youth bulge means the younger generation will seek a more autonomous role in global affairs. They will ask questions, they will reverse the order much more than one can anticipate. And so dealing with that coming questioning of the global order from Africa. Now, the Brits are a different thing. South Africa is the only one at a national level. But this is West Africa, over 20 countries altogether. So what does it mean? It's hard to tell. But in the next decade or two, the sources of European industrial raw materials is going to come more and more under scrutiny from Africa. Because the young folks who ask them questions and they are coming not only migrate to Europe over the mean we've mentioned that Europe can as well try to turn the Mediterranean into a war like Trump tried to do for Mexico. Because the thinking and there's broad consensus on this, this West African conflict, the African world altogether. Not only those countries, these folks have support all the way across the black world. People like me, the Caribbean, who want to feel that they are part of the African broader global landscape. The African American who is part of the US. And in the 60s, there was a strong interplay between the civil rights movement and African independence movement. They were very complementary. They shared notes. So this is galvanizing the African world in a way that one hasn't said before. Joseph Juan Sabo in math, we talk of the butterfly effect, where a little very unassuming activity in one part of the world globe can send a wave around the globe. So this curator, out of nowhere is sending a wave around the African world and is inspiring them to push even further up north. And the argument is, look, we are used to the way the west functions. Had ever reported, our colleagues here of the security community would know this better. But the way they function for the last since the colonial days, africans know that if they push forward, they can lose 10% of their population on these things. Kill us as you want, but the 90% that survives would undo these processes that they've endured for the last 300 years. That's the thinking I see among leaders on the continent. So it's a long game. Bokinabe Young President 34 year Old he said, look, we're not done yet. This is just the first shot of a 100 year war to reclaim their place. So the conflict in West Africa will not finish so quickly is the first shot. And almost all Pangofun African countries especially, they are feeling the heat. Their militaries are a little bit anxious of who is going to roll next. There's like a network now of security persons in these countries. They are looking at how if the political order in those countries is subservient to Europe, then they are not a legitimate ruler of those countries. So they the poop plotters. They are important themselves to say, we have to take our countries, our continents, back in our hands. And if countries like Nigeria, which is 200 million people, which by 2040 will be 500 million people more than the US in population, that's antimic and almost all youthful, they cannot react the way they intended in West Africa, then it means that there's unanimity or some harmony of thought among the emerging young class in Africa. Niger being as close to Nigeria. The next leadership of Nigeria, the current leadership is the current person is about 80 year old. He belongs a regeneration that's just post independent. So Nigeria is just waiting for those who made a coup task in the 70s, who had difficulties maintaining the country to exit. In the next 510 years, there'll be a whole new cadre, a whole new radical movement. So I think the west should brace itself to see a whole different Africa that they're not instinctively ready for yet, because of giving how they've always operated. And Africa is really working to reclaim at least a minimum of its own resources. They may not have the means yet. I keep saying the scientific means, the technological means to do things themselves, but they're being inspired. Dimitri mentioned about the role of church and spirituality, their own religion. When you hear the word Boko Haram, boko Haram, that's been mentioned many times as a terrorist group. Boko Haram in Northern Nigeria between Nigeria and Niger actually means no to the west. So Boko Haram for them is not terrorism. They are just rejecting the west model. So those fighters are not really as bad as the media wants us to think. In their own inspiration, in their own vision, is to replace the west by their own African structures and spiritual institutions that they've lost some, but to reclaim as much as possible so many of the Girding movements that are seeing conflict, maybe in Africa, the Africa's own expression of saying, look after independence, we were pushed back substantively. Eventually, I will share on the Chat group a document, if you have time to read it's very long. You would see the treaties, the accords that these African countries were forced to sign by the French retreating colonial powers. You'd be amazed at what they did. That means at the end of, quote, unquote, what we call end of independence, they were forced to sign treaties that made them even more colonies than before. And that's what they've been operating over. And the current generation is saying, we cannot keep this. We have to reject all of them. So you see, the first thing that these leaders do is reverse all those colonial agreements, cancel all of them unilaterally, and that's causing difficulties in Europe. So what does it mean for all of Europe? I don't know. As part of the expansive Western world that benefits from French value in West Africa, it's not very clear. We know that when France function or the US function, NATO is a front army that they use. How would all of them play a role in this? It's not very clear. But any conflict in West Africa, for any country, it would have a very regional backlash. Africa may very well be the source of the next global conflict. Already in 1914 and 1939, we believe that the two world wars were conflict between European countries about who owns what part of the river south, what part of Africa. So we see some similar thing coming. Europe's or Frances or America's intervention in Africa would save you along the same line who owns what peace, or what real estate, or what resources. But African is pushing back more than ever before. So at least for us in this group, and I know the sources of information, western, typical media outlets, they are classical in how they want to look at the interests of France versus Russia or versus the US. And strongman and which not strongman. Those are real artificial now. There's a really undergirding energy in Africa. There's a surge in Africa. There's a feeling of optimism. There's a feeling of that our time is coming. What the folk couldn't do between 1970 and 19, 2010, kind of post colonial stability, the young folks now are doing differently. The conflict lines are being withdrawn. I will not be surprised to see in the next few years some kind of street activity against European interest. Not even by the state, by regular people, because that's how much they feel anger across the board. They may just well be broad anti European sentiment, but especially anti France. So with the West, African countries contain it. They don't even want to. Even if the elites wanted to, their own citizens will not allow them to do it. It's like Africa's own Arab Spring. Not the same characteristics, not the same dynamics. We know that the Arab Spring didn't go too far. The west contained it within ten or 20 years. But how will they contain Africa? Do they want to contain it? I don't know. But the dynamics are different. This is really what we want to see as the implications of Africa's demographic surge. Different questions, different dynamics, different conflicts, and different push to reverse mean at the bottom of the blockchain. So we will see. But the French are off for a difficult near term because these are four countries, five, actually, including Algeria. Algeria being the only country, one of two countries that actually fought a war of independence with the French. So these countries are banning together. They have been already talking of having their own federation as a common front against France. And again, the biggest enemy that these counters see in front of them when you look in the mirror, is France. And what does it mean? Some of these things are things to wait and see how it evolves. But Africa is coming up of age. Africa is coming up and there's broad support for it. So I'll leave it at that.

Speaker B:
Thank you. And Kim Devinda, you may have received this morning, like me, from our colleague Ram madIf in India, who's a colleague of our call, but he rarely can attend. But he definitely follows what we're talking about here. But Ram, very interesting. Just this morning sent an article that he wrote reflecting on the partition meaning between Pakistan and India. And I just bring this up because I just found it quite shocking that these issues are being revived, it seems. Anyways, Davinda, if you could make a few short comments, I think it'd be useful. Thanks.

Speaker A:
Good morning, good afternoon and good evening. I think picking up on Enken's point about the long impact of colonialism. The issue in the subcontinent has to do with colonialism as much as the partition of India and Pakistan into separate entities. At the time of independence, it divided families, people, and also there was East Pakistan, which is now Bangladesh, that separated from Pakistan in the early 1970s and went off to become their own independent country. The basic premise of drawing lines in the sand, as Nkim pointed out, is that these are artificial lines drawn on maps by the colonial powers, and they do not reflect the reality on the ground of cross border migration, as well as exchange of people and religions and so on. And I think the divisions that are being faced in the subcontinent have as much to do with the artificiality of the lines that were drawn on the maps. That independence. And these issues are being revisited as much as the younger generation in Africa is rethinking colonial heritage as well as both the good and the bad. And the subcontinent is facing similar questions, and it will be a very disruptive way forward in the Indo Pakistan relationship. There is a disputed territory of Kashmir in the north between India and Pakistan, and a sliver of it that China is claiming as well. So there are a lot of threads that are unraveling from the colonial era that will create a lot of disruption and a lot of risk to the geopolitical balances in regions and globally. Thank you, Phil.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Devenda. So, Alex, if I could come back to you for sort of a wrap up and reflection as well. But I'm speaking of political unraveling in Thailand, for example, and then how you extrapolate that on, really, as we started out, the call today and the focus of data there's data in the subcontinent, data in Africa and China is the one that is pretty effectively assembling the troves of data. So Alex, if you could think through this and then help us summarize today. Thank you. We can't hear you, Alex.

Speaker A:
Sorry, I muted my microphone. Yeah. So I think today's topic is quite broad and wide. I think we start off by hearing Elf talking about the business in China and they actually set the stage. Now, I would like to first talk a little bit about the Thailand first, thailand has been over the last 20 years has been pretty unstable. I will say that it started off very well with Tafsin being a very popular premier and he got a popular vote optimally because that he has been facilitating and able a lot of ruler people, able to borrow money, the farmer, and of course that makes all these people like him. Now, that is a fundamental point for the democracy to start. But in the city, in Bangkok, there are the people who are royal to the king as well as the political elites or other business elites together. Now there's three factions out there fighting and eventually the military come in and everything change. That doesn't mean that all these forces are not fighting, they are continually fighting. So most recently, when people get sick and tired of all this impasse and the government is not moving and people livelihood is being affected, eventually a new party, moving forward party has kind of like won the majority of what's it called vote. But in the parliament system that is adapted and changed by the military, whoever wins doesn't mean that he gets to control the government. So ultimately, Pita, who is the leader of the winning party, Mufo Party, didn't manage to secure the premiership and unfortunately so in that situation, he don't have a choice. In fact, he's kind of like being what's it called, being kicked out of the whole thing because he owns share of dormant company. Now, in that situation, then you notice the second largest company, which is Britain, which is also taxin''company, now be able to now work with the incumbent to form a new party or rather new alliance. Now, the big question right now is that Britain was opposition and he's now working with the existing Conservative line with the military party. That is a very big question down here that are they going to be stable? Because have they betrayed their traditional supporter base? But having looked at this one, you also indicate that see that the party is party politics is politics. So long they can win, I think they will do all kinds of deals. So we are seeing the whole thing that come one big round circle for Thailand. And from the outside observer, that perspective is that so long the government is stable, if the government is stable, all kind of business will work. And I think that should be okay. Now, the most interesting thing that happened in fact just a few days ago, that Thailand has more or less agreed that the trade and transaction with Thailand, they will use remedy. So instead of transacting US dollar, they will transact all these things in local currency, which is what reminisp because China is one of the largest trading partners. Having understand that, we begin to see that there's quite a number of places that transaction begin with R and B. In fact, if you count those people who applied to what's it called joy bricks, BRICS, they more or less control over 60% of the oil production around the world. Now, if they are successful, which also means that bricks, whichever brick new currency could be, could be the currency for the new petrol currency. So you're talking about 60%. That's quite significant. These are the changes that we are seeing and the underlying changes that what we are seeing is exactly as what Phil mentioned about data. So data is everywhere and whoever owns a lot of data, it will help them tremendously. Now, take for example that Alibaba, years ago he accumulated a lot of delivery data, the amount of delivery data that they have, because everybody buy on this Taobao and on Alibaba platform, all the delivery data are there. Now, with that data, Alibaba was able to use it to help construct the traffic model for Hangzhou. So Hangzhou traffic control was it system implemented by Alibaba. So you can see that the data is very important in that kind of aspects. So as we get more and more digital, I think we also share in the group Chat that some country, for example Australia, New Zealand and I think some European countries begin to reduce the usage of cash. In fact, in Singapore we do the same thing. Also, some of the restaurants just simply do not want to accept cash because they mentioned that by not handling cash they reduce about 60,000 a year cash, I mean the dollar expenditure. So there is tangible benefit, even though there is a percentage being charged to Visa, Mastercard, et cetera. But overall there's still benefit. And increasingly all this transaction data will be very useful for us to shape a lot of things to understand a person to understand, to use it for training of AI. In fact, in Zoom, the new what's it called, Eula, the End User agreement came out that to use zoom you have to agree that they will use the data to train their AI. Exactly how they train it, we do not know. But that is actually a global trend we start seeing and that eventually blend into a lot of things that we are talking about right now. Now we notice that Africa is going to be a very large population because the whole Africa is one point something billion in total. As Ankim mentioned about, Nigeria has 200 over million people. So it's pretty populous. The only key challenge is that education is one of the issue. The second one is that infrastructure is not connected. All right. So once that is being done, I think a lot can be done. But switching back to look at our data eventually there's something that is connected back to what we talk about data. And data eventually is something that's very interesting. I always find that interesting. But data is behind me is a lot of mathematics and mathematics eventually linked to our human quantum and what's it called biogenomic. And one of the very important things actually the spirituality. Now, I just want to highlight one difference between the east and the west about the spirituality. That the Western spirituality usually surrounding a religion, right? The monotheist is God. But the Eastern spirituality a lot of time there isn't God. And the spirituality don't really refer to a religion. So I think those who hear, I think George Yo speech or the video that we share basically George mentioned that in Asia most of the place there isn't a God. There's a lot of deity that going all over the place but there isn't a unifying God. In fact, the unifying God is what eventually the Asian were so called synthesized as a Tao or the way you can call that a God, okay, if you want to. But that is very different in term of thinking. But in Asian the spirituality basically can categorize a lot of the things that we don't understand including things such as easing the Book of Change, right? It is basically mathematics, it's actually a calendar but it is also a way to divine what people who don't understand what the future could be. So as a form of divination, I think someone put inside the chat that something that government cannot answer. But sometimes Asian will consult the book or change. So all these are very cyclical and rhythmic and we trying to make sense eventually put together. I think that our conversation today is actually beginning to move into a very interesting direction that we eventually able to blend a lot of things and trying to eventually make sense especially from a different perspective. I especially like Jason and Dimitri to share about the Orthodox Church and what you do. And of course I have one question. Does. Orthodox church eventually will create a digital God. I mean, we see that happen in the west, right? So they have an AI become a creature. But will that happen in the Orthodox Church? I am quite doubtful about that because of being a conservative kind of thinking. I think they were still separate. I think they are not so adventurous. But having understand the quantum physics and quantum space and the Chinese space I think eventually all the digital space and quantum may eventually fuse together and begin to make sense. Whether it is right or wrong, I'm not too sure about it. But I think that may be the direction that we can explore and understand further. But it's a very good conversation to help us understand a lot of things and especially also Victor contribute that understanding down there for us to create a much more holistic view about what is happening around us. But I think most important thing for us is to understand each other and from there, I think we can figure out what to do next. Thanks and back to you, Phil.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Alex. Our conversation today clearly went in some very unexpected directions, I would assume. I think all of us gained. I thank yelena for coming back and helping to steer us in that direction and the rest of you following up on the discussion. So thank you very much, everybody. Have a great week. Some of our colleagues are obviously away on holidays and vacations and some of them are not feeling well, but I'm sure we will all be back in larger numbers in the coming weeks. So have a great week, everybody, and thank you very much.

Speaker F:
Thank you. Have a great week. Bye, eyes. Bye.
