- The Global Call, held on Saturday July 29, 2023, involved several representatives from various countries such as Japan, China, U.S., Singapore, Sri Lanka, UAE, Russia, Ireland, UK, Germany, Brazil, Cameroon. 
- Mr. Naoto Hamada mentioned his current location is Eastern Australia and the temperature is around 20 degrees Celsius. He enjoys reading and appraises the food quality in the country. 
- Dr. Alex Lin addressed the issues of using algorithms for summarizing call notes and generating questions. Their goal is to make reviewing their meetings more efficient.
- Participants like Jonathan Paris and Naoto have been calling from Portugal and Australia respectively; meanwhile, the rest are scattered across various global locations.
- The participants discussed Portugal's long-standing treaty with the UK. The Admiral Miller mentioned former visits to Portugal. 
- During the call, there was a discussion on Japan's economic situation: business investments have been revised up to +13% accelerating economy growth, Bank of Japan is starting strategies to normalize its monetary policy, yield for 10-year bond is capped at 1%, but no changes for the shorter term. The spending cost estimated by Ministry of Finance, due to 1% increase in debt, would cost about ¥4 trillion. They predict it will be the upcoming 15-18 months before the short-term interest rate structure begins to change.
- Mr. Louis Curran relates Jesper's points to Asia's economy, taking particular note of the strong correlation between Dollar-Renminbi and Dollar-Yen. He also discusses the implications of the Biden's Inflation Reduction Act and Chips Act, leading to corporations building plants in the US stimulating the economy.
- The market has been generally pessimistic, yet prospects of the S&P look promising for this year and next. European Central Bank is trying to dampen the strong Euro but hasn't succeeded, which implied that global growth and the stock market is looking bright, especially if the Dollar continues to roll over.
- Dr. Howard Morgan is optimistic about the economic recovery provided that Trump does not run for office again. He sees Powell's fixation on 2% inflation as unnecessary as historically, 3% inflation was considered normal and did not negatively affect the economy. 
- Dr. Morgan is preparing for a trip around the world with the National Geographic and Wall Street Journal – the locations include Kyoto, Seoul, Singapore, Ulan Bator, Samarkand, Tallinn, Helsinki, Lapland, Reykjavik, and parts of Iceland. They're particularly looking forward to adding two new countries to his previous count of 101. 
- Dr. Morgan's partner, Eduardo Saverin, one of the largest shareholders in Meta, has experienced a decrease in his shares from $300 to approximately $80 within the last twelve months.- Facebook's stock value rose from $80 to $325 within the past year. 
- The U.S. stock market has shown strong resilience amid economic fluctuations, with evidence in companies like Coinbase bouncing back. 
- The U.S. currently boasts almost no unemployment rate, partly attributed to decreased immigration rates and robust job market conditions. 
- In South America, Brazil's economy is progressing contrary to prior pessimistic predictions. 
- Political uncertainties persist in Argentina with upcoming elections, and Peru experiences heightened complexity with recurring public protests and a historical record of six presidents within six years.
- Former Thai Prime Minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, may potentially return to the political scene. The situation remains unpredictable due to complex party politics and legislative structures.
- In Cambodia, the political environment is changing with an expected transition of power from Prime Minister Hun Sen to his son, Hun Manet, after elections later in the year. 
- The Cambodian election process, noted for its rigor and public order, encountered a noticeable presence of international observers, some of whom are part of intelligence groups or think tanks.
- The Cambodian people exhibit high enthusiasm and adherence to the voting process, with a turnout of 84.3% in recent elections and only around 3% of spoiled votes.
- Sri Lanka recently played host to several international diplomats, including a Member of the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, French President Macron, and the Japanese Foreign Minister. 
- These interactions seem to mark Sri Lanka's significant standing in the Indo-Pacific region, and especially crucial as France is the fourth largest creditor to the Sri Lankan government.
- The Chinese Politburo member’s visit is seen as important for how China will contribute to Sri Lanka's debt renegotiation process. China does not participate in the Paris Club Forum on debt renegotiations and assumed an adjunct role.
- The Japanese Foreign Minister will make further visits to Ethiopia, Uganda, and South Africa, coinciding with the BRICS National Security Advisors' inaugural meeting in South Africa.- The second Russia-Africa summit took place and the number of Heads of State present was fewer than the first summit. However, 48 out of 54 African countries participated.
- Pro-Russian newspapers and liberal media offered contrasting views on the numbers, with the former emphasizing the number of attendees while the latter pointed out that 38 out of 54 countries did not send their Presidents.
- The main outcomes of the summit included security cooperation and Russia's forgiveness of over $23 billion in debts to several African countries.
- Russia agreed to provide free deliveries of 25,000 to 50,000 tons of grain to six countries, reviving its grain initiative suspended after an attack on the Crimean bridge. This move was seen as Russia's attempt to resolve food security concerns in these African countries.
- Memorandums of Understanding were signed with the African Development Organization and Economic Community of Central African States, indicating cooperation in various areas including education.
- Russian Defense Minister Shoigu met with the North Korean leader to strengthen military cooperation.
- Unrest in Africa, particularly in former French colonies, led to occurrences of expected coup d'etats.
- Large quantities of Africa's wealth, estimated at over $500 billion annually, are held in the French treasury, and these African countries have no control over their own monetary policies.
- France's presence and control in Africa stirred a revolution among the newer generation of Africans.
- The Sahel security problems in West Africa were viewed as caused primarily by French military activities.
- Many speakers at the recent Russia-Africa summit were from French-speaking Africa, showcasing a shift in alliance from the West to the East and Russia. The main attendees were countries facing sanctions and pressures from the West.
- Activities from the Russia-affiliated Wagner group were observed predominantly in French-speaking African countries.
- African Union meetings reflected the French-speaking officials' frustration with English-speaking ministers, accusing them of letting French control undercut the continent.- African countries are frustrated with their old colonial masters, primarily France and the West. This is due to their undermining of African initiatives and hampering their development efforts.
- An anecdotal example provided involves an effort to establish a science granting agency in Cameroon, which was intercepted by French agents who pledged support but didn't deliver. This is perceived as a common tactic to stifle African development.
- Failure of Western entities to respond to African aspirations is leading to an increased Russian presence and perceived Eastern Bloc influence. Notably, Dmitry mentioned a $23 billion loan forgiveness to Africa.  
- African countries are reliant on loans from outside entities due to zero fiscal space, and are thus trapped in a cycle of debt and reliance.
- Language shifts, such as Rwanda changing its national language from French to English, are happening as a form of protest against Western influences. 
- There is a growing sentiment of animosity towards the West and France particularly amongst Africans. 
- The youth of Africa are viewed as a "second coming", bringing in a new era of alternative business practices, industry, science and technology. They are frustrated by the old colonial system's hindrance to their aspirations.
- Africa is increasingly looking eastwards for partnerships, where there is no history of colonial control. Russia and China are particularly significant.
- Despite appearing supportive in public, there is broad consensus amongst African countries to pivot away from Western and towards Eastern influence. 
- Western involvement in Africa is met with suspicion and cynicism, due to troubling past interventions, for instance, over resource control in Niger.
- Deep-seated frustration across African societies is leading to coups and military intervention. This is seen as the only way to challenge the system.
- African states defy their former colonial masters and express their frustration through actions like forming anti-colonial coalitions, especially evident in West Africa.
- The AI sector had a meeting with seven leaders, hosted by the White House, to discuss guardrails for AI, the outcome of which was seen as theatrical. 
- Concern over the rise of disinformation, particularly through AI, and how AI tools can be misused despite commitments made to prevent such misuse.
- Big strides are being made in brain-computer interface (BCI), with AI playing a significant role. It's seen as a promising path in helping those with severe disabilities or neuro-degenerative diseases.
- On semiconductors, there is skepticism about room temperature superconduction, with belief that physics doesn't support it. Despite this, China is heavily investing in it due to reaching physical limits with semiconductors. Current superconduction requires high pressure and low temperatures.- Dr. Howard Morgan and Mr. Peter Bloom discuss physical limitations on semiconductors. A proposal has been pitched to decrease the size from 3 nanometers to 1 nanometer, suggesting semiconductor sciences mat not be 'done' yet.
- Both agreed that a step-function transformation such as super-conduction may be necessary for further advancements.
- Dr. Morgan disagrees with common sentiments that we have reached the physics limit of semiconductors, therefore deeming it possible to further decrease size.
- There is skepticism about the chatter about superconducting.
- Discussion moves to the Oppenheimer movie's missed opportunity to highlight prominent female physicist, Professor WU Jian Xiong, who was involved in the Manhattan Project. Skepticism about Eastern influence in such matters. 
- Mr. Peter Bloom, a close friend of the movie's executive producer, commits to finding out the reasons behind this omission.
- The movie, despite notable star casting including Matt Damon, is not showing in Japan and no release date has been confirmed.

- Further discussion on AI involves its misuse and abuse by people, and how its development might differ if treated as a life-form. 
- Final discussion includes prevention of code injection to fool AI systems, and the potential effort required to prevent misuse of AI.
- The session wraps up wishing the best for colleague Alvaro who is set to participate in a gliding race series.- Jesper Koll highlights weak macro order data from China specific to FANUC.
- Roberto Alvarez shares a link regarding an unmentioned plan from Brazil, predicting it could lead to new investment opportunities, but also stressing the long way from intent to impact.
- Louis Curran points out Mr Gao's significant observation unrelated to major developments in China, referencing an unmentioned relationship with Enerfy/Nuclear Fusion. Curran underscores Gao's belief that it could be as significant as AI and stresses on its potential.
- Curran further suggests Global South versus the west as a contentious subject of high interest, encouraging further discussions and insights on the topic.
- Alvarez shares about public-private roundtables discussing regulated carbon markets in their country as part of a government consultation process, highlighting an already drafted new regulation.
- John Alton corrects an aspect of the discussion, implying the focus should be on Superconduction, not semiconductors.
