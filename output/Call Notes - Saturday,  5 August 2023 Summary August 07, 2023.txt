Pre-Call Discussion:
- Issues discussed include the burning of the Koran in Sweden for publicity, personal gains, and immigration-related reasons, which led to police intervention and court overruling.
- It was discussed that these acts of burning the Quran showed a lack of respect for others' beliefs, and compared to insulting national flags or constitutions. It was suggested that there should be respect for other people's fundamental beliefs. 
- The absence of punishment for burning the Koran in Sweden was noted, which several participants saw as problematic. The need for government intervention was stressed.

Discussion:
- Louis Curran discussed economic movements, particularly in China, and the implications of the U.S. credit rating downgrade for mortgages globally. 
- Uprisings against colonial powers in Africa as part of the Global South's rejection of G-20/Davos were noted.
- There were major effects last week, causing global interest rates to rise steeply to a precarious level, potentially leading to a stock market sell-off and rapid rise in unemployment.
- The importance of AI in boosting stock markets was discussed, with companies like Microsoft and Nvidia leading the way and Apple's valuation crossing above $3 trillion.
- The fact that Japan's central bank has maintained interest rates below zero for over 20 years was also mentioned, with concerns raised about potential difficulties in increasing them.
