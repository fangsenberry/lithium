Speaker A:
Nephew. Nephew is.

Speaker B:
Hey, John. Good morning.

Speaker A:
Some food for tonight. Morning. Hey, John. Good morning.

Speaker C:
Good morning.

Speaker A:
How are you, sir? I'm good.

Speaker C:
Are you driving again? You're always.

Speaker B:
Well, Saturday night he picks up his daughter at ballet.

Speaker A:
I'm about to dad.

Speaker D:
Before the daughter.

Speaker A:
Leaves for the college. And I have only three years, maybe four years. This is my precious time with her.

Speaker B:
John does that every day with his son with swimming and soccer.

Speaker A:
Okay. How old is he?

Speaker C:
I have two sons, one's 15 and one is getting ready to turn nine. Both swim.

Speaker E:
That's good.

Speaker A:
My daughter hates swim. Yeah, well reason why? Somehow she gets a really strong shoulder and she's a ballet person. She doesn't want to look like a barky lady. Barky girl to dancing with your ballet just so funny. I don't want to swim because my shoulder gets right. All right. That's the point.

Speaker C:
Well, I don't particularly like swimming either, but I do it.

Speaker A:
Yeah, well, it's good.

Speaker B:
Oh, John, you get a I I'm in Beijing and I had a meeting this afternoon. This lady who is one of the key people meeting with this afternoon, she said well, and then we're reconvening after this call this evening. But she says to me, she says, I have to go do my Qigong now.

Speaker C:
What's her position?

Speaker B:
She's no, she's a pretty interesting entrepreneur.

Speaker C:
What's her age?

Speaker B:
I'd say late 40s, maybe 50.

Speaker C:
That's good. Remember that one group that we interfaced with back in 2008? And I asked all of the it was a brigadier general, the woman doctor, military doctor. And I asked them if they practiced and they said no, that they would wait until they retired and then they would start practicing, which was an odd attitude. I'm glad to see that the pendulum has shifted back to where they're not putting it off.

Speaker B:
Good afternoon, Alvaro.

Speaker A:
Good afternoon, everybody.

Speaker C:
Hi, Alvaro.

Speaker A:
Good afternoon.

Speaker B:
So anyways, this lady I just thought it was an interesting point. Well, John and noto know my daughter, but so, Alvaro, I arrived in Beijing today and about the same time my daughter arrived in Ethiopia. So we're covering the world. But that's not unusual for my daughter. She's very much an Africa turning into be.

Speaker A:
Know when we are young. Middle name is Lawrence. Do you remember the movie Lawrence of Arabia?

Speaker B:
All right. No, that's okay.

Speaker A:
I used to call the Lawrence of China. Now I call the daughter as a Julia. But the gen of Africa. She goes everywhere in Africa. Ethiopia is scheduled to have about 300 million people in about 20 years. A large country like Indonesia.

Speaker B:
She has a contract with UK aid, their overseas development fund, and she does insertions of teaching technology into primary school education in various countries for the next three weeks. And not in Aris. She's 2 hours south of Aris Sahaban. And then she goes from there in uh anyways, she's probably is like Jane. That's what she does, and she loves what she does.

Speaker C:
Well, I have a funny story about Ethiopia. I've never been there, but I taught at a community college a while back, and I had a student from Ethiopia who was quite accomplished. He'd published five books, and he was a nurse, so he had all of his Ethiopian credits, but over here, they don't really translate. So he was having to get.

Speaker A:
You.

Speaker C:
Know, I solicit for the benefit of the American students. I just go, Any foreign student that comes in, I go, Tell us about your life. And he told horror stories about Ethiopia where he was just railroaded into jail. And he said it was like a kangaroo court. You show up and, you're know, the charges are stated and you go to jail. And apparently he had been in the local jail in Charlotesville, Virginia, and he was saying that how nice it was. He said, you guys, don't said jail here is like a Dane described what it was like in an Ethiopian jail. And then afterwards, I sort of pulled him aside and I went, wow, it's fascinating. And I said, you know, I'd really like to go to Ethiopia one day. And he looked at me and he goes, well, if I were you, I might not go there, because I know some people that might think that you would make a good slave. And I looked at him, I'm like, are you serious? He was like, yeah, I don't know what Ethiopia is like. Now, that was maybe ten years ago, but it was eye opening to that and many other students from Africa that shared their experience that sort of woke the American kids up, because they just live in a bubble here. At least in Europe, you go to different places and interact with people with.

Speaker B:
Well, I'll get Juliana call some Saturday soon, and she can share a few of her experiences. So interesting, you bring up jail. This is before getting started with our call, I've had a rather interesting week. I started in New Delhi and then onto Colombo and then onto Hong Kong. And now I'm in Beijing. Anyways, in Colombo, this was not the reason I was there, but they took me to see the national prison in Colombo, which was built 100 and some years ago. Anyways, they want to redevelop the property and build a new prison, and they have a very good plan and architecture and everything set for it, but basically, they want to take this property in central Colombo and redevelop it. So I found out more about prisons in Sri Lanka than I'd ever thought I would know, but it's not a good situation. Three to a hundred years, a hundred year old. I mean, it was an old fort and Kim so you're in Nairobi?

Speaker A:
Yes, I got there already, so I'm getting settled in. Hello, everybody.

Speaker B:
Well, you look great. Coming in clear.

Speaker A:
I'm outside with the balcony with the sun, so it's bright.

Speaker B:
And Kim has met my daughter as well. And so, Kim, I was just saying, Julia arrived today in Ethiopia, so we're just chatting about that a little bit.

Speaker A:
Okay. Can you hear me?

Speaker B:
We can hear you just fine.

Speaker A:
All right.

Speaker B:
Sister Nelda. Good evening. And Mr. Gao. Good evening.

Speaker F:
Good evening.

Speaker A:
Good evening.

Speaker B:
Phil. Mr. Gao. I'm not very far from you now.

Speaker A:
Yes, I know. You're in Beijing, right?

Speaker B:
I'm in Beijing. Everything was very smooth. Was a very active Saturday afternoon in Beijing and lots of traffic, lots of people. Tomorrow we'll be at Qinghua with Professor Bai and look forward to seeing you on Monday. So Robbie Green, who's also here, he's at a meeting, a dinner meeting right now, but he's also here as well. And we'll be going to see Mr. Gao on Monday. I'm very much looking forward to seeing you. Nishan good evening. Well, welcome back and great to see you. And there's our friend Tom Sato, who I think is back in Japan. But interesting enough, Tom and I were together in Sri Lanka on Monday.

Speaker A:
Yeah, that's right. What I found very interesting. That's great.

Speaker B:
I didn't think he was going to go back to Japan. He was loving it too much.

Speaker A:
Must be busy. He stayed in a hotel area, which is nice. It's not much of the flight, France, but I just wanted to kill the old flights in Sri Lanka. Whenever I eat in the restaurant there. It's very beautiful place.

Speaker B:
Well, this was Tom's first visit, so he can give his impression later, but I think he had a good time. Demetri good afternoon. Hey, Jason, Victor and Devenda. Good morning.

Speaker E:
Good morning.

Speaker B:
Devenda. Good morning, Phil.

Speaker A:
Phil last week, while you're not here, I asked Sister to comment about the visit to so she said she will do next week, which is this week, so I hope she is ready to speak about.

Speaker B:
Well, as a matter of fact, as I mentioned before, some people got robbie Green, one of our colleagues, is here in Beijing with me and Sister Nilda. Robbie and I will be going to St joseph's Cathedral tomorrow morning to mass.

Speaker F:
That's good.

Speaker B:
Peter, good morning.

Speaker G:
Good morning, Phil.

Speaker A:
How are you?

Speaker B:
I assume you're in Maine, right?

Speaker G:
We are. But the storm that was predicted to like no one's going to survive has.

Speaker A:
Turned out to be complete nothing, which is good.

Speaker B:
We just came up from Hong Kong today, and there were two recent typhoons, as our Japanese colleagues and Mr. Gao would know, in the region. But it wasn't the typhoon winds that hurt Hong Kong so much. It was the incredible rain, apparently. But it seems like they've recovered quite good.

Speaker G:
I don't know much about China's practice around religion. Is a cathedral, a Catholic cathedral something that the Chinese government grudgingly permits? Or is it something that just is part of society? And there are parishioners who can go anytime they want.

Speaker B:
Well, okay, so I'll just start off. We'll just start our discussion. I'll start with that. And then we'll go to Sister Nilda. And as Victor and others may know, Mr. Gao knows as well, I've been trying to help the dialogue between the Vatican and China for about 20 years now. I'll just say it bluntly. I think there's quite a bit of bad press about the real situation here with religion and the Catholic Church especially. But I can assure you, and I'll be going at 630 tomorrow morning, but the Church is active and you walk in and you go to Mass, and it is an absolute buy the book, Roman Catholic Liturgy. And I think, of course, there's hard points here and there, but I think China and the Vatican have made a lot of progress in communication and in establishing just things like how bishops are selected and this sort of thing. So I can say to you that there's a lot of progress and it's using American colloquialism. It's the real deal. It's a real mass. And yes, people freely go. But there is a very interesting history of the Church here, and it goes back to the Jesuits 300 and almost 400 years ago. And one of the cathedrals here in Beijing was actually founded by Father Mateo Ricci, whose grave is here in Beijing. And he's an honored person, and his grave is absolutely kept up after 300 years. So anyways, I'll just say it, there's a lot of unfortunate negative press, but I think the communication is stabled. So with that in mind, and I think this is an appropriate purse, Sister Nilda, if you could just give some reflection, because the Pope was recently in Mongolia and there were a collection of Chinese pilgrims that went up to Alambator and also from Russia, there were pilgrims that went for the visit. And so, Sister Nilda, if you could just start, I think we'd appreciate some reflection and understanding. Thank you.

Speaker F:
Thank you so much. I did do some research, got some information about the Pope's trip to Mongolia, and let me tell you what I found. Pope's actually, in last year, the Pope created the first Cardinal of Mongolia. Can you hear?

Speaker B:
Fine.

Speaker F:
So this first cardinal, Father, he was Father Giorgio Moreengo, he became a bishop, and then now he's already a cardinal. When he was created Cardinal, the former president of Mongolia went to the ceremony and invited the Holy Father to go to Mongolia. And the Pope accepted the invitation. Let me give you the words of the Pope. Why? He said, people may ask why the Pope is going to see such a small flop of Catholics. There are 1500 Catholics in a population of 3.5 million Mongolians. Then the Pope says, well, it is because it is precisely there, far from the spotlight, that we often find the signs of the presence of God, who does not look at appearances but at the heart.

Speaker A:
Sorry.

Speaker F:
He looks not at appearances, but at the heart. And the Lord does not look for the center stage, but the simple heart of those who desire Him and love him, without ostentation, without wanting to tower above others. And I had the grace of meeting in Mongolia, a humble church and a joyful church, which is in the heart of God. And I can testify to their joy of finding themselves also at the center of the church for a few days. So just the center of Christianity, because Mark's also the.

Speaker B:
I think we have some audio problems. Sister Nelda, with you, can you hear us?

Speaker F:
Seven years ago, an envoy of the Pope visited the third Mongol Emperor Guyug, and presented an official letter from Pope Innocent IV, which the grand can answer after a few days. And a copy of this letter is I'm sorry, this letter is preserved in the Vatican library. And the Pope brought a copy of this letter as a present to the present president of Mongolia. And he said the Pope said, may it be a sign of an ancient friendship that is growing and is being renewed, because, as we know, after the Mongolian empire fell, catholics also disappeared. We do not know why. And we have just started with the Catholic Church in Mongolia a few years, maybe during the 1990s, when the first Apostolic prefecture was opened. And then another event in Mongolia that the Mongolians are celebrating is the 860th anniversary of the birth of Genji scan. Let's not analyze history, but Pope Francis sees a very positive side of everything. And so he said he was talking about what was the PAX Mongolica in Mongolia, and he said, may heaven grant that today on this earth, devastated by countless conflicts, that there be a renewal, respectful of international laws, of the conditions of what was once the PACs Mongolica, the absence of conflicts. And may the dark clouds of war be dispelled, swept away with a firm desire for a universal fraternity where tensions are resolved through encounter and dialogue and the fundamental rights of people are so the Pope said that he accepted the invitation because he also wanted to know better these noble people of Mongolia with their strong religious tradition. And so he was happy to be able to participate in an interreligious meeting with the different representatives of the different religions, but also of the different Christian churches. So it was ecumenical and interreligious meeting. I can read to you some of the excerpts of the Pope's speech during that meeting.

Speaker B:
Sister Nelda, your audio broke again. There.

Speaker F:
Already sends a message. It shows that the religious traditions, for all their distinctiveness and diversity, have impressive potential for the benefit of society as a whole. If the leaders of nations were to choose the path of encounter and dialogue with others, it would certainly be a decisive contribution to ending the conflicts continuing to afflict so many of the world's peoples today. The beloved Mongolian people have made it possible for us to come together for mutual enrichment, for they convunt a history of coexistence between the followers of various religious traditions. It is impressive to think of Karakorum, the ancient imperial capital which admirably housed within its walls places of worship belonging to different creeds, thus exemplifying a commendable harmony. Harmony. I would like to stress this word in its typically Asian accents. Harmony is that special relationship born of the creative interplay of differing realities without imposition or amalgamation, but with complete respect for their differences. In view of a serene life in common, I ask myself who more than believers is called to work for harmony among all brothers and sisters? The social significance of our religious traditions can be gauged by the extent to which we are capable of living harmony with other pilgrims on this earth. Every human individual, and even more every religion, must be measured by the standard of altruism. Not altruism in the abstract, but in the concrete, an altruism that translates into concern for others and generous cooperation with them. Because altruism builds harmony, and wherever there is harmony, we find understanding, prosperity and beauty. The religions are called to offer the world this harmony which technological progress alone cannot bestow, since in its concern with the earthly, horizontal dimension of humanity it risks forgetting heaven for which we remain today we are meeting together as the humble heirs of ancient schools of wisdom. In our encounter with one another, we want to share the great treasure we have received for the sake of enriching a humanity's so often led astray on its journey by the myopic pursuit of profit and material comfort. People in our time are often unable to find the right path. Concerned only with earthly interests, humanity ends up destroying the earth and mistaking progress for regress, as attested to by so many injustices, conflicts, persecutions, environmental disasters and great disregard for human life. Our coming together here today is a sign that hope is possible. It is possible to hope in a world dreamt by conflict and discord. This may seem utopian, yet the greatest undertakings are hidden and are almost imperceptible at the outset. While the fragrance of flowers spreads only in the direction of the wind, the fragrance of those who live according to virtue spreads in all directions. Let us make this conviction flourish so that our common efforts to promote dialogue and the building of a better world will not be in vain. Let us cultivate hope. It will be beautiful if you can read the whole talk, because it's longer and there are many other things that he said, but let me just finish with that one. And then, of course, the Pope with Catholics of Mongolia. He also mentioned how the Christianity began there during somewhere around 1310 with the first bishop. And then well, as I said, with the end of the Mongolian Empire catholicism little ended we do not know why. But anyway, the first missionaries in 1992 started again with the first Mongolian, with the Mongolian Church of today. So let me see. So he also talked to the Catholics of Mongolia, and he says, taste and see the goodness of the Lord as it is in the Psalms. Let me see if I can find the rest here. And then he said, Spend your life for the Gospel, because you have tasted the Lord who made himself visible, able to be touched and encountered in Jesus. Yes, Jesus is the good News, meant for all peoples. The message that the Church must constantly proclaim embody in her life and whisper to the heart of every individual and cultures. Brothers and sisters, the Christian life is born of contemplating the Lord's faith. It is above all love daily encounter with the Lord in His Word and in the bread of life and in the faces of others, the needy and the poor, in whom Jesus is present. And then he also mentioned that people might be afraid of the Church expanding too much. He says the Church has no political agenda. He says the Church is born of that mandate. I'm sorry. The Lord Jesus, in sending his disciples into the world, did not send them to spread political theories, but to bear witness by their lives to the newness of his relationship with His Father, which is the source of concrete fraternity with every individual and people. The Church born of that mandate as a poor Church, sustained only by genuine faith and by the unarmed and disarming power of the resting Lord, incapable of alleviating the sufferings of wounded humanity. For this reason, governments and secular institutions have nothing to fear from the Church's work of evangelization, for she has no political agenda to advance, but is sustained by the quiet power of God's grace and a message of mercy and truth, which is meant to promote the good of all. And then the Pope also inaugurated the House of Mercy. The House of Mercy is a charitable institution of the Church, where there are variety of charitable of kinds of charitable works, like it's a safe haven for people who cannot find anybody who would listen to them and so on and so forth. And so the Pope blessed this house. And then he told an anecdote which I would like to end this one, this is my summary. And he said that one day there was a journalist who was talking with St. Mother Teresa of Calcutta. And Mother Teresa of Calcutta was bent over a house smelling man who was sick, had plenty of sores. And so this journalist went to her and said, mother Teresa, what you do is beautiful, but personally, I would not do it even for a million dollars. And Mother Teresa answered, I would not do it for a million dollars either. I do it for the love of God. So that's it. There were some journalists who were asking the Pope questions at the plane. If somebody would like to know what he said about that question of the Pope's remarks about Russia, maybe I can read you his answer. There was this journalist who said your remarks to young Russian Catholics about Great Mother Russia, the legacy of figures such as Peter the Great and Catherine II have caused some discussion, have irritated Ukrainians, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. Would you like to say something about this? And the Pope says you have to talk. Let's talk about this in the context. It was a dialogue with young Russian people. And at the end of the dialogue I gave them a message. A message that they always repeat, that they take responsibility for their heritage. That is the first point shoulder your legacy. I say the same thing everywhere. And with this in mind, I try to create a dialogue between grandparents and grandchildren, that grandchildren embrace their legacy. I say this everywhere. And that was the message. Secondly, in order to clarify that legacy, I spoke of the idea of Great Russia because the Russian legacy is very good, it is beautiful. Consider the field of literature, of music going back to Dostoyevsky, which today speaks to us of a mature humanism. They took up that humanism which developed the arts and literature. This would be a second aspect when it spoke of their legacy. The third point, perhaps it was not very opportune, but in speaking of Great Russia, not in a geographical sense, but in a cultural sense, I remembered what we were taught at the school about Peter I and Catherine II. So this third aspect came up. Maybe it was not quite correct and I said it. I don't know. The historians can tell us. But it was an additional thought that came to my mind because I had studied it at school. Yet I told the young Russians to take charge of their legacy, to shoulder their legacy, which is to say, not to purchase it anywhere, elsewhere. Take up your own legacy. And what legacy has great Russia left Russian culture with its great beauty and depth and should not be cancelled on account of political problems? There have been dark years in Russia, but its legacy has always remained intact. You spoke about imperialism. In fact, I was not thinking of imperialism when I spoke. I was speaking about culture. The transmission of culture is never imperialistic, never. It is always a dialogue. And I was talking about that. So this was the Pope's explanation answer to that question. I hope that has given serenity to all of us.

Speaker B:
Absolutely.

Speaker E:
Thank you.

Speaker B:
Thank you, sister. Nola, that's a perfect place to begin after reflecting on the notes from all of your discussion last week. And Alvaro, if you don't mind if I call on you, because I quoted you in the invitation to this call today. And Alvaro, you have mentioned to us in the past. Some reflections from your own great grandmother about this. But you did ask the question, how do we weave through the challenges? And so what? Sister Nilda just brought up reflections from the Pope's visit to Mongolia. If you could share with us some of the thoughts that drove your comment last week, I think that'd be very useful, if you don't mind. Elvaro.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Phil. Rather than a comment, it was a question. We heard a beautiful analysis, and Luna said, how can we vaccinate or fortify or build the self judgment capacity of the newest generations, including ourselves? I think all of us consider ourselves still very young. That allows us to analyze what is happening. And it is essentially a quest for culture. And two words that Sister Nida Castro said today about the comment of the speech of the Pope strike a very strong chord within myself, which are harmony and respect. These are cultural goods which are in great deficit in the current Western Hemisphere, I would say. I don't know why, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but I feel that the increase of this is directly needed and how to go about it, which is the prerequisite for getting the tools inside us to analyze what's happening. I don't know. Maybe some have it internally. I don't know whether it can be taught. But unless we grow strongly harmony and respect, which are prerequisites for tolerance and dialogue, I don't know where we're going to go. I feel we are losing, we are going backwards in this game of putting the world together. But these are my thoughts. I'm afraid they are maybe of very little help. It's more a lamentation than really contributions.

Speaker B:
Well, thank you. You're right, it is a so. Appreciate you leaving that last and in that regard, Tom Sato and Tom and I had the chance to be together this past Monday in Sri Lanka. But talking about travel and harmony, tom started over a week ago in Israel and then came back through Sri Lanka. And I think, Tom, if you could reflect a little bit, not just on what you were doing, because I think that's interesting in its own regard in Israel, but your overall impressions from your trip, I think it would be. Thank you.

Speaker E:
Okay. My trip report. Yes, I'd be happy to do that. Well, I spent two weeks on the road, and it was very interesting having been back to Israel for three and a half, maybe more three and a half years. And I wanted to see what's going on because I'm doing a lot of Israeli business in Japan at the moment. So I had this chance to join the Japanese delegation to go to Israel to find innovation and so on. It's a government program, and Israel and Japan has this economic and trade treaty on innovation and technologies and startups and so on. So Economic Minister Nishimura headed the Japanese delegation organized by Jetro, the Japan External Trade Organization. And there were supposed to be this conference and meetings and matchmaking sessions for Japanese tour to go to some of the innovation centers in Tel Aviv and so on. But besides that, I caught up with many of my friends and had chance to walk around the streets of Tel Aviv and so on. And I'd like to sort of talk a little bit about that. Not about the technology or the business aspect, but overall feeling about Israel. And compare that versus Colombo in Sri Lanka and where I am right now, right in the middle of the mountains in Japan. And what I have found significantly change in Israel is the cost of the living. It's incredibly expensive there. I don't know how they can survive at this level of inflation. The hotels were extremely expensive just having breakfast or cup of tea or coffee I spent around about 3 hours at the hotel lobby coffee bar doing some negotiation with startups and that amounted to close to $100 just for a few snacks and coffee and so on was amazingly expensive. I went to some restaurants and they were expensive and so on and I can feel that the average people are quite stressed out about these costs. On the other hand, the startup people and the people in the tech sector they're spending like no problem at all. They have money. They went through this bubble era two years ago when tech sector went through this huge m A boom and a lot of people do have still have that money left to spend but they do admit that it is extremely expensive in tel Aviv in terms of people there. I think they are under a lot of stress from the political situation they are in with the current administration trying to change the constitution such that the supreme court won't have so much power over the government. At the moment there's only one Knesset, which is one house of parliament and there's no check and balance with two houses like Japan or in United States so Supreme Court functioned that part and essentially this small group of people at the Supreme Court can torpedo huge acts of parliament or the current administration do not like that. On the other hand, the tech sector do not want the current administration to have such a huge power. So there's demonstration going on every weekend. I arrived on Friday and I had a meeting Saturday morning and first thing I was asked was if I wanted to go and join the demonstration. Who am I to join an Israeli demonstration? I'm Japanese person, I don't know anything about these things but here it is. These demonstrations are everyday things for Israelis and they are very stressed out about this situation which I don't like because Israel is a tinderbox. They had 5000 years worth of conflicts from religious conflicts or racial conflicts to all sorts of problems and massacres. I understand. That the Jerusalem was flattened 27 times during the past 2000 years. Anything that really bad things happening into Israel have a global impact and we don't want. So my meetings business side was okay. I discovered and met a lot of great entrepreneurs and great technologies and all but on the other hand, Israel got me really worried about the Middle Eastern situation. Then I went to Sri Lanka because the ticket I bought allowed me to spend some time in Sri Lanka at a very reasonable price. I was going to go to Dubai first but Phil said that he was spending a couple of days in Sri Lanka, why not? And besides, I've been talking to a couple of Sri Lankan friends like Divinder here and he introduced me to nice people there and we were talking about a variety of things and I wanted to understand a little bit more about the country because I've never been to Sri Lanka and boy I really enjoyed Sri Lanka. The economic troubles I can see and it is a huge problem but it's the nicest place on the planet. The beach are nice, the people are nice, the entire hospitality and tourist industry welcomes you and it's just great. The food was great. The hotel, I say that was one of the oldest hotel from the British colonial days and superb service. Breakfast was amazing, dinner was amazing, they had many bars and I could relax with Phil at the veranda sipping away drinks. And I thought that rather than serving industrial, technological side of the economy, I think really, I mean Sri Lanka should get its economy together with the tourist and travel industry. It works very well compared to the hotel. The flip it, I stayed in Tel Aviv or the hotels I'm used to in Tokyo, which is very functional but very small and very limited and not so much in terms of hospitality and entertainment. Sri Lanka has all of that. I'm pretty sure you enjoyed Sri Lanka. I want to go back there right think, you know, if I could comment a little bit more about the Sri Lanka and the economy as a whole. It went into huge problems last year and the current administration and leadership is trying very hard to solve it and it is happening one step at a time rather slowly. But I did not see foreign companies like Chinese or even Japanese coming right back into the city. The port city which is right offshore of Colombo is still not under construction. I did not see any construction at all. The Japanese had been involved in renovating the main international airport there, but the main construction company which was going to do that, Kaise, just gave up and left. And the two governments are trying to figure out how to get it going with another construction firm, but they're having a huge problem trying to convince another Japanese company to come back into this project. I've talked to the head of jetro at Colombo and he was saying that number of Japanese are still there but many have decided to leave Sri Lanka altogether, which is problematic. On the other hand, Sri Lankans want to go to Japan. I was talking to the taxi driver and the waiters at this hotel and also the bank admin person because I went to change some currencies and all of them say are you from Japan? My son or my daughter will be going to Japan to study and to get some job because the Japanese have opened up the borders for students and that they're welcomed and they want to really learn Japanese and get some skills in Japan. And Japanese schools are welcoming overseas students these days because we have declining birth rate and population, so they need overseas students to make ends meet for their.

Speaker G:
Know.

Speaker E:
I was really surprised by this that the Sri Lankans wanted to come to Japan and to study and they're sending them to Japan. I understand that many Sri Lankans go to overseas, like to Dubai or to Israel, to Europe to work and in variety of industries and Japanese have been trying to import Manpa for past five years because of lack of working population here. And so I think there is a shift for Sri Lanka from other nations which is pretty harsh in terms of immigration and guest workers now to Japan which is very much welcoming. All in all, what I found out about this trip is that world is really changing. When I looked at the situation in mean I was quite alarmed by the tone of the government and how stressed out the people were, which was different from three and a half years ago. It was first time for me in Sri Lanka and I discovered a new great nation and I can't wait to get back there. I think Phil is right in globetrotting around the world talking to everybody and everybody trying to figure out what they're doing, what are their issues, and creating dialogue between bilateral or trilateral or multilateral like here. I think people need to travel a lot more and talk to each other a lot more. I think I learned that very well in Sri Lanka. Thank you Phil.

Speaker B:
Not only that, Tom happened to be in Sri Lanka when the South Asian cricket championship was going on and he took the time to go to the Bangladesh Sri Lankan match.

Speaker E:
Yeah. Sri Lanka. Trashed Bangladesh. I think Bangladesh people were very upset because it was 257 to like nine. Yeah, it was a very interesting match.

Speaker B:
Dimitri, you spent some time in Sri Lanka, I think was about two years ago, but if you could just follow on with Tom, just some thoughts about items you're noting. But specifically I remember you spent some very good time in Sri Lanka, so Dimitri please.

Speaker D:
Hi dear colleagues. Yeah, that's true. I spent almost five months in Sri Lanka and I really enjoyed that time. I can say that it was really good to live there because talking about hotels or even some rooms, because I rented one room with a local owner living upstairs and we had really good and interesting communication. And I would say that like Sri Lankan people, they have a lot of hospitality. Also talking about Russia and Sri Lanka, I would say that actually we had some good ties with Sri Lanka because talking about United Nations, I know that Russia helped for several times Sri Lanka, and once Russia banned some resolution which could harm Sri Lanka. And also Russia helped to Sri Lanka to become a member. As I'm not wrong, I was in Sri Lanka during that time when it was the climax of this fuel crisis. But what is interesting, during that time, we could observe big lines and people spent, I don't know, several hours, I would say almost days there in these lines just to get some fuel. But if you are a tourist driving this bike, you could come there and all locals, they would give you just go directly to this gas station and get your fuel. Because they understood that these people also give some contribution to Sri Lankan budget. Or probably they are really like tourists and they are really friendly, or this is a mixture of these feelings. But it was really pleasure for us to see that they would like to help us. What else? I would say that probably there are several interesting projects, I guess in Fertilizing sphere between Russia and Sri Lanka. But they are only some like, let's say zero stage. They haven't started yet, but probably it would be a good cooperation. Yeah. And also I would like to add some ideas to aywara's comment because I think that it is a really important thing just to dialogue. Dialogue, it is the most important brick to build our society and to build understanding between countries. And unfortunately, right now we can see some movements, as Alvara says, some movements back. We cannot understand each other anymore. And it's really sad that there are some movements which lead us backwards. For example, you know that several Western countries just banned Russian cards to enter Europe. So it means that if you own a Russian car, whatever, even if you have a second passport, you cannot cross the border towards a lot of European Union countries because your car even could be confiscated. Moreover, according to this law, or according to your commission recommendations, some personal items of Russian people could be confiscated. And in one week I will see how it works, actually, because I'm going to go to Switzerland on my business trip and I'll see if they will confiscate my phone or not. But I could say that these moments cannot help and cannot improve our dialogue. And I guess that's all from my side.

Speaker A:
Thank you so much.

Speaker B:
Thank you very much, dimitri and so that gets to dialogue and technology. And Alex, clearly Singapore has played a significant role in propagating technology for advancements of communication and governance. So Alex, if you could just give us an update please and other thoughts you have at this.

Speaker A:
Was I was thinking a lot so my talk can be a little bit confusing right now. First step I think from Elbaro triggered us to start thinking of what can we do, what is next and taking the input from Sister Nelda as well as Dimitri, I think all of us are pointing to a certain direction. I'll just start by thinking what Sister Nelda has mentioned about the Pope visit and of course pitching about peace as well as harmony and peace and harmony is exactly the most lacking complexity right now around the world. I'm not sure how we are able to achieve that. Maybe a small part, but eventually that we are drifting further and further apart, the east, the west, the north and the south exactly as what this Dimitri has mentioned. When Dimitri mentioned about we cannot understand each other. No, I think I disagree with that. I think we understand each other perfectly well. We know why the west want to do that. Sometimes it doesn't make sense the NQR, but we understand why the west want to do that and we understand how Chinese react especially standing from Singapore Southeast Asia perspective we can see both sides clearly, both partly involved. Mostly we are bystanders to look at the whole situation and at the same time that we also work very closely and trying to integrate the digital part of the whole thing. It is a very delicate, confusing situation. But as I mentioned that the Harmony is definitely not there. I just take a very recent example of the electric vehicle. So the EV, China EV has been shipping the world and being exported to everywhere. It is cheap and good with a lot of very interesting technology, especially that Huawei now developed a new technology that able to navigate even without very clear terrestrial map which means that the AI in the vehicle has been doing very well. But that is not the most significant thing that caused the disharmony of conflict. But it's because that Munich car show almost become a Chinese car show. So this EU commission, EU basically they want to now investigate the Chinese subsidies. Now this in other words almost like a sanction but if you really look at this one as a sanction then you begin to realize that Europe may try to protect fixed car industry but the situation turned out to be exactly the opposite. Why they say it's opposite? Because the moment that announcement made the EU car company share price dropped. And why would that be? Because there's a way to protect them but the share price drop. Ultimately what we are seeing is that because majority of the EU car manufacturer market is in China by doing. So it actually hurts the EU car manufacturer. So not just on the production, not just about what's it called, the supply chain and everything, but the market itself. So by having a Sanction rather announcement of pseudo Sanction, you hurt the new car manufacturer. Of course, the businesses are not very happy about it. The only one that benefit from this whole thing is Tesla. Tesla share price went up. Of course we will be jokingly saying that the announcement actually to benefit the US and the benefit of Europe. But what I'm bringing out this point is that for the technology part of it, you still cannot run away from the politics and the global business is so what's it called connected that you can't what's it called, do a simple sanction and achieve the kind of objective of damaging the other opinion. The other one is that pushing back the history a little bit, that we look at the Huawei situation, huawei during Sanction, not just once, but six times. Practically most of the people are looking at this Huawei situation is that US government is fighting Huawei on behalf of Apple. Right? But Huawei return, huawei returned with an interesting good handphone. Huawei Mate 60 p. But surprisingly, I've been asking all my friends in US. Have you heard about it? Okay, nine out of ten have not heard about the phone. All they get is only Apple iPhone, it's been launched and also exciting, et cetera, have not heard about Huawei. Now, granted, that probably is not being sold in US. So they may not hear about it, but in terms of general news, they should know that that is something that is very interesting. A new phone that is potentially much better than iPhone and happened before iPhone is being launched, but the news is not there. But when I look at the Sanction wise, you say who can hurt it's? Not just Huawei, but the whole supply chain, Qualcomm. And all these companies are not able to sell a lot of chip to Huawei. So right now even worse, and Huawei able to produce and get the supply for SMIC they need to buy from Qualcomm. So the Sanction eventually is not just hurting Huawei, but also hurt the American company. So when you look at holdings of this technology war, it is basically politically driven, but it is not very well thought of. And for one finger you point at all, you are having the other four finger pointing at yourself and does it benefit the country? I'm not exactly sure. And drilling deeper and you start looking at Apple. What happened to Apple for the past few models? There isn't a lot of breakthrough. Basically what we are seeing is that Apple is enjoying that US government sanctioned Huawei and we lost the market share and is happily riding on the loss of Huawei and there's no innovation. And now Huawei has managed to do a lot of innovation and come back. What happened to Apple? Does he have another chance? Probably not. So I would hope that Apple take this lesson and quickly start integrating. Maybe the next version, iPhone 16, can be a lot better, but maybe not. We do not know. So when I look at this disharmony as what sister Delta has shared, this is getting increasingly difficult to integrate everything. So in the UK is trying to plan the AI summit, AI governance summit. And on one hand wanted to invite China to be there because it's actually one of very important players heavy AI investment. But yet they're trying to restrict the participation of the Chinese. So if we are looking at that and said would China even want to participate? My thing is that forget about it. Chinese has run its own AI conference so much bigger, why would I even bother to participate in the event run by UK, who is not even AI powerhouse? So you start looking at this so called basically the kind of disarmament everybody trying to anchor for something. This doesn't make sense at all. But going back to the Asia and Southeast Asia, what we are trying to build is to working towards integration. The best way to integrate is through trade and digital. So there's quite a number of the digital government initiatives coming up. And having said that, is that the digital government initiative will be able to connect everybody the trade at this meter. I think the most important thing to solve, as I mentioned earlier, is basically local currency transaction that allow us to be able to use our own currency instead of finding a common currency. Now, common currency has a certain advantage as we share inside the chat, but eventually the one country where the common currency become a reserve currency, he has to suffer the consequence of having a very heavy debt because he has to supply and print a lot of currency, for example, US dollar for everybody to use it. So it would definitely be a country with deep, deep debt. And how to get it out is not going to be very easy. Any other country interested to replace China? I mean, replace us? Unlikely. I don't think China is interested to put the mint as a common currency because it simply will put China in very difficult positions and it will then end up US current situation. So what is the future going to be? I think it's going to be very difficult for us to tell, but that will circle back to what have asked the question what is next? I'm not sure that what we can do. I really do not know what we can do right now. We can analyze, but we can't do anything to change it. But I think digital space is one of the interesting potential for us to do digital space for us to integrate further. Looking at Sri Lanka situations, I'm just drawing what's the similarity between sri Lanka and Singapore 50 60 years ago, we wanted to be like sri Lanka is doing much better than us because Bors are island and Boa has a very strategic trade route. But with the increasing what's the popularity and capability of China made high speed rail, that will change the situation quite significantly because the land route can be very fast and very cheap. Going from instead of going to the, what's it called, through the sea route from China to Europe, you can go over via land route and be fast. If more and more railroad is being built, I think the situation will change. Now, Singapore will be worried about our significance because Singapore was successful because of the trade route. But we know that our portfolio has dropped yearly. There are less and less requirements to go by sea now. That is the kind of situation in the world chain. And even for Sri Lanka, if they are focusing on being a crowd port function, I think that is something that is going to be very worried because it may not last for very long, maybe five years or even less. So they will need to develop. And I think tourism and all this thing is fine and well, but if another pandemic come by, the tourism will die again. So something more tangible will likely be digital. Digital space development for Sri Lanka is something that has to be done and Singapore is up in this game on. So in the whole scope of things and technology is something that is very critical to continue building and things are changing and changing very drastically. So we do not know what our future can be. To basically answer overall question about it, I think we can slowly figure something out along the way. And that is probably my part of this reflection and my apology for being jumping over the place, because I'm still trying to collect and structure my thoughts. Thanks and back to you, Phil.

Speaker B:
Thank you, Alex. Let me just make a comment. So I'm in Beijing, as I think I've told most of you. I just arrived earlier today from Hong Kong and I was taken by two entrepreneurs to a place called EV World here in Beijing. Mr. Gao, I don't even know if you've heard about it, but it is a total experiential park of EV automobiles. And it was incredible to see. This is a very family friendly, huge park, and almost every major auto company in the world is there. And it has a racetrack, so people can experience the EVs, whether it's Porsche or Lamborghini or even the Hongqi. The red flag now has an EV model of China. The point is, and I think we had one article this week, and I don't doubt this number at all, but 20% of all vehicles in China are now EV. That's just incredible. In Beijing. It's 30%. In Shanghai. Mr. Gao I'm sure it's probably over 30% but this just drove in my mind just this afternoon. There are huge changes going on that I've seen in this country over the last 40 years, but there are just huge changes, and I think we're missing the larger picture. And that also goes to Alvaro's point and then what? And Robbie Green and I were at a conference. I was very pleased that the conference did happen this week in Hong Kong between the US. And China financial officials. So discussions are going on. It was a productive conference, but we just have to take some note and think about huge changes that are going on, and not just in EV, but in digital in that sense. Peter, if you wouldn't mind, you're hearing a lot of things that sort of out of your sector today, but as Alex says, and I'm sure you'd agree, that the digital side is changing things beyond maybe some that we realize.

Speaker G:
So please, Peter, the conversation is so rich, and I have learned so much I didn't know on this particular call, on almost every call. So I'm going to keep it really short, Phil, because I'm just enjoying this conversation on other subjects. Number one, if anyone wants to make a ton of money, it turns out I learned this week in a conversation with a tire repair shop, this was a random conversation, that they are flooded with EVs because the traction motors that drive the wheels wear out the tires really fast. So if you're looking for a retirement plan, you should either buy a tire repair shop or invest in a tire company. Because apparently the unintended consequence of EVs is they're chewing through a lot of tires really fast. Just two super quick things. I tend to be a little dire in these calls, so I'd like to be a little more positive. One thing is that we talk so much about AI, and Alex mentioned the Chinese government, and the one place where we're seeing probably the most dramatic early AI results that are positive and actionable and evidentiary proven is in medicine. So there's just so many applications now where AI is proving to accelerate the development of pharmaceuticals, the development of diagnostic capabilities and things like that. So I just wanted to just at least start with something very positive. The other thing on AI that's become super interesting because it's very typical of the sort of boom and bust nature of technology, is that OpenAI has reported for the third month in a row a decline in usage. And I think one of the reasons for that is that for all of us, after we got done goofing around with it, there aren't really very many practical applications yet. If you're a high school student, you can write an essay. If you're a medical researcher, you can use it for diagnostics. But one of the reasons OpenAI is seeing this significant decline in usage is that for most people, it's still a novelty and it's not being applied for practical use. So I thought that was just interesting. It's not, by the way, a prediction that this won't be one of the most important developments in our lifetime. It's just that it's very typical to see this exuberant boom followed by a kind of a decline. And then I think what happens, you see us slowly as people start to realize where they can most productively use AI. It'll be on the way back up. The other thing, too, which we talked about two or three calls ago with Howard, is OpenAI, is under significant financial pressure as well, both from the point of view of cooling and energy consumption. So it's estimated they're spending $700,000 or more per day to provide this free product. And I don't care who you are, you could even be Microsoft, and you can't keep spending $700,000 a day without some financial return. So it's going to be super interesting to see how all these AI companies ultimately monetize the results. And then the last thing I want to mention just because, again, it's just a super cool, interesting, like, who knew this unintended consequence? I spent a lot I was a technical advisor of the Federal Communications Commission for many years. And so it turns out that cell phone antennas point to the Earth. So the reason that you lose your cell connectivity above 3000ft on an airplane is not that you're not in range of a cell phone. It's that the lobes, which are the electromagnetic waves that emanate from a cell tower, are actually focused down terrestrially so that your cell phone can get a signal and they're not focused up because there's been no use. So now what's happened is with all the commercial UAV and drone applications delivery by Amazon Air Taxi and others, everyone realizes that the cell network can't serve all of these new businesses that need the cell network to work. And so there's pressure now on the cell industry to refocus the entire network. So it sort of points up as well as down. And the only reason I bring this up I know it's super nerdy, is it's another example, Phil, of where we have this technical infrastructure that's been laid down and works incredibly well until a New Use case comes up, and then all of a sudden, rumors, wait a minute. For this New Use case similar to what Starlink did in Ukraine for this new Use case. Now we need to reconfigure this technical infrastructure. So it's going to be really interesting to see what happens over the next couple of years with the cell network as the pressures from above start to equal the pressures from below. And then the last thing I wanted to say about Starlink in Ukraine, because it's been in the news so prominently and it alludes to something Alex pointed know, we've seen with Elon Musk and there's been a lot of press about this. I don't need to repeat it, that he made a decision not to activate Starlink in Crimea that would have aided Ukrainian naval attack. And whether you believe he should have or not is not the point. The point is now we have an individual actor who is replacing a state actor with some really significant capabilities, and we're seeing that in AI. While that's certainly true, it's really going to still be the state actors like China who move the AI revolution forward most significantly. Because now back to this point about OpenAI and the $700,000 a day, it actually turns out that for the most part, no private company can hope to equal the resources of a government when it comes to deploying AI on a significant scale. So stay tuned not just for the activities of the Chinese government, but the activities of other governments who decide that this is in their best national interest, is to make these investments related to AI and not end up with an Elon Musk sort of situation where you end up with one or two private companies controlling the future of this incredibly exciting technology. And with that, Phil, I will go back on mute.

Speaker B:
Thank you.

Speaker G:
I have to run down actually, I have to leave because I have to go buy a tire store.

Speaker B:
Okay, have a great week and we'll get you notes and look forward to seeing you next week. Salia, if you could just introduce yourself and some of us know you and Tom and I were just with you on Monday. Salia is in Sri Lanka. He's in the media tech environment. And so, Salia, you're hearing all of this for the first time today and just wondering if you have some thoughts, but just quickly, also just introduce yourself, please.

Speaker A:
Thank you. Thank you so much.

Speaker B:
And we can't hear you very well. I don't know what something about your mic, maybe?

Speaker A:
Can you hear me now?

Speaker B:
You can much better. Yes.

Speaker A:
Yeah. Thank you, Phil, for connecting to the group. And it's been a great journey with you and David, Tom and Alex in this group for the last few months. My background is nearly 30 years experience in Asan as banker, reader, bank, and we got into payments and the digital economy side of it. And the other thing is that I'm heavily into the media side. Media tech what? I have listened to my colleagues who spoke earlier, especially on the AI side, especially on the digital economy side from the Sri Lankan perspective. I'm working with Alex on another project on involvement with Jai Casper to build up a startup ecosystem in Sri Lanka. The other project is going on RFP done. Sri Lanka having gone through probably the worst economic catastrophe post independence of 1948. And right now we have declined bankruptcy. But there's a civil lie because our foreign remittances have gone up about 50% and the tourism is back 70% earnings. The export income has gone down by. 10%, but the imports been further by severely. So Sri Lanka is coming back to normalcy from where it was one year ago.

Speaker B:
Sorry, if I could just ask you to try to speak more directly into the mic because it's still a little bit the audio is a little bit shaky.

Speaker A:
Can you hear me now?

Speaker B:
This is better. Yes.

Speaker A:
Yeah. So what I'm saying that Sri Lanka have come back to normalcy from where it was one year ago with mass protests, the chaos that we had the earlier president in the country, especially after President Vikrama Singh took over. There are a lot of silver linings in the economy and space that we are operating right in the country. But given that another presidential election in the horizon in 2024, country is getting ready. But the sentiments are very different in the country when you talk to people and research reports are saying otherwise as well. It's a very interesting space, especially on the digital economy. I would say the next five years is the key for Sri Lanka and anyone who takes the power, the digital economy is going to empower the country to get into the next level. So there's huge opportunity back in Sri Lanka for the tourism and the whole country as all of the digital economic.

Speaker B:
Well, thanks and welcome and great to see you and Alex. As Salia said, Alex and Tom and I have had a very good ongoing discussion. So great to see you. Mr. Nishi, it's great to see you again. And some new events have taken place in the last week. If you could just offer some comment with North Korean leader Kim and President Putin having a meeting and Kim Jong UN is still in Russia taking various tours and things like this. But Mr. Nishi, if you could reflect on both, on what you're sensing regionally at the time and especially this activity with Kim Jong UN was very nish san, please.

Speaker A:
Thank you, Phil. Yes, it is very interesting situation to see that North Korean reader shows a very serious attitude towards Russia. It's often a mistake of the Japanese media that the relations Russia, China and North Korea are close, which is not really true. They make a kind of, say, alliance of convenience against the United States, but in reality, the bilateral relations of each other is not really good. So the recent activity of, you know, visiting Russia and asking more support of technology, of space rocket, these kind of things, that is kind of say a threatening message to China because now North Korea is developing their missiles with nuclear capabilities. But that is in a sense a certain message to China. During my days when I was engaged the abandoned chemical weapon issues in China, we once had a chance to discover the chemical weapons very near to the North Korean border. And at the time, Chinese side advised us, the Japanese side, to damp it again with beautiful camouflage, not to be detectable. The reason was that area was within the reach of the special units of North Korean forces acting midnight almost every day. So that is apparently a kind of invention. And Chinese side were aware of it, but at the same time, they did not want to pick that issue up. But still, they pay a very special, say attention to this North Korean initiative. So the transfer of technology from Russia to North Korea is not a beautiful message for China. And that means that Kim Jong UN is now what? Difficult to say whether he is really shifting his position more to the Russian side, rather say more distance from Beijing. We have to pay attention more with that prejudice. That's what's going on among these relations among these three countries and what that impact upon the security environment in Northeast Asia. So Kim Jong's visit, yes, it is the interesting one and triggering something, the new debate dialogue in this region. That's what I feel now. Thank you very much, Phil.

Speaker B:
Thank you. Nishan and I look forward to seeing you in the coming weeks. So thank you very much and great to see you again. So, Mr. Gao, we're hearing a lot, and Sister Nilda kindly started the discussion with a mission of peace and trying to connect east and west in a peaceful, harmonious way. And my own reflection today from just being in Beijing and seeing what I see, I see a very active, positive environment going on here. If you could share with us your thoughts and how you sense the situation right now, because there are a lot of critical issues going on. So, Mr. Gaw, we look forward to hearing your reflection. Please.

Speaker A:
At first, I would like to add some comments to Nishang's comments on North Korea leader Kim Chen's visit to Russia. At first China and North Korea. The relationship is different with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe satellite countries. North Korea is an independent regime. That means Mr. Kim Jon will do as his own interest, his independent interest of North Korea. So of course, we respect that. I think this time when President Putin and Jung meet together in Russia, they play a very skillful diplomacy and they can have what they want separately. That means that Russia can have the ordinary weapons from North Korea and North Korea maybe can have space rocket techniques from Russia. And we noticed that in this year, North Korea's own, they launched space rocket twice and failed. And I believe that they really need some space rocket techniques from Russia. And that gives me an impression that I think in the past few months, we discussed that if President Putin had more pressure in Ukraine conflict, maybe he would use nuclear weapons. But nowadays we find that maybe he didn't use in that way he can use in the east side. That means if he exports some of the techniques, no matter nuclear techniques or space rocket techniques, it will create great trouble to not only United States, but also to the allies of United States, such as Japan and South Korea. Of course, we know that the stance of China is very clear that we object. We always insist non pro liberation of nuclear weapons, and we do not like two blocks confrontation. Many people will suggest that in the future there will be two blocks in East Asia. That means United States, Japan and South Korea. And the other side is China, Russia and North Korea. But we don't like the two block confrontation in the future. So that did not fall into China's interest. I think that's very clear. But also nowadays, I think that suggests US that we really should be careful about Russia and the Ukraine conflict. Otherwise, President Putin is very scarce to use his nuclear weapons not only in the battlefield, but also in the foreign affairs. So the second issue I would like to comment is that just this week, I think maybe Wednesday or Thursday, secretary Blinken gave a very important speech in John Hopkins University. I just read his speech. I think this is very interesting. And he spent a lot of time on new diplomacy and US. Support to developing countries. And the US will we know that when President Biden visited India and visited Vietnam, he announced that US. Will raise about a new project that's about altogether $600 billion to help the infrastructure of developing countries and will help to build a new corridor. That means connect the harbors of India and Middle East countries and even African countries. So how China build this project? At first, I think that maybe some of the US. People will believe that this is a competition with China's Belt and Road initiative. But in fact, I think if this is really a competition, I think that could be a good competition. Because at first, at the beginning, we know that our Belt and Road initiative cannot fulfill all the need of developing countries. We need all the major countries to do their contribution to the developing countries. And if the states can really raise enough capital to help developing countries and that can even benefit China. That means because they are our neighbor regions. If our neighbor regions becomes more stable and more prosperous, that can benefit China at first. We will have better market. And even that could make our belt and road project more profitable. And so I think China will even appreciate it if Secretary Blinken didn't mention that Chinese project on OROB will damage the environment of the neighbor of the so called Belt and Road countries. And if he didn't mention that the other countries should not accept China project. But anyway, we think that could be a good competition. And we know that thanks for the Belton Road Initiative that now the west will have to follow to give more spot to the developing countries. But anyway, I think this could be a good competition, but there is some other potential bad competition that concerns us. I just noticed that also this week, Think Tank in US. ITIF Information Techniques and Innovation Foundation think tank released a new paper, said that now there is two approach towards China. One is speed up us. Invest us. That's okay, no problem. And the other approach is slow down China. That means to stop China's development. So that can concern us. And nowadays we find that it maybe is not only the proposal from Think tank, many congressmen, they also fall into that direction. Just these few days, ten US congressmen headed by Congress foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Macau signed a letter to White House that it said that US should tighten sanctions on Huawei and SMIC. SMIC is the leading chip company of China. And it even says that US should launch criminal charges towards the leader of Huawei and SMIC. And we think that's the bad thing. That's the bad competition. That means we can accept the speed up US. Just accept. We understand that. But if the states used the other approach slow down China, that's unacceptable. So I will stop here. Thank you very much.

Speaker B:
Thank you Mr. Gow. And I look forward to seeing you on Monday, actually. So in our wrap up and Kim, if you don't mind if I ask you, so now you're new and repositioned in Nairobi. You're in the number two position at the African Academy of Sciences. And so you're hearing our discussion today and then going back to Alvaro's question. And then and Kim, if you could just share a few brief thoughts. And in the coming weeks, we very much look forward to your assessment and evaluation coming from your new position. But if you can just give us your perspective and then what? Thank you. You're on mute there.

Speaker A:
Okay. Can you hear me? Hopefully, yes, thank you. I've just been here for less than a week now, trying to settle in at the academies. But the academy is Africa's largest cluster of scientific leadership. Like the US Academy, the JST and all the other leading academies around the world. The African countries have individual academies, national Academies per country, smaller sized. But then where I am here in Nairobi is the continent's global regional academy. So they are mandate and their purview is larger than individual and national academies. And I'm finding it very intriguing that now, having flipped the coin from the US and seeing now in Africa the lenses through which I see things are already changing very fast. When I see them, I'm already getting conversations not so much about Africa, about the global north. Now looking at what perspective and how the global map, who are the actors and who are the player and who are the.

Speaker E:
Character.

Speaker A:
And how they reset.

Speaker B:
And Kim, your audio is not so good. Yes, if you could speak clearly in the microphone, your audio is a little okay. Can you hear me.

Speaker A:
Again? Just last two weekends ago, the Kenyan president hosted Africa's Climate Summit. The previous summits have not only been driven by African leaders, africa has been part of a global conversation. But then now they the convenience summit to articulate Africa's position within the Global dynamics. Given that Africa contributes less and suffers more most from climate change, the issues of financing and promises kept or not kept, and the war on how Africa can articulate its own interest, its own vision, its own position. So it came out very strongly, but it also generated lots of diversions from the regular climate conversations. So from this perspective here, Africa is trying so hard to assert itself and articulate its own positions, bring its own via, its own thinkers, its own leaders, not, as usual, to receive what Global North policy and funding, but to articulate their own and demand a better bargain. So it's quite a different conversation. Part of my task here is to develop the think tank aspect of the academies. So all the discussions that we're having here, how do we advise African leaders on this thing? African, not only political leaders, corporate overall leaders in this changing scientific landscape, and how science and technologies is impacting the global dynamics, especially the African side. Things like infrastructure, things like the big investments, the Birth and the Chinese Silk and Belt Road Initiative. It enabled lots of domestic development within China because it was handled by Chinese themselves. Manpower, their own engineers. The money circulated within Chinese economy and society. Anyone who does big investments in infrastructure and doesn't use their own manpower is pretty much capital fly. So how do African countries develop their own infrastructure with their own manpower? Do they have it? How do they get policy advice on that? How does all this technology that's coming up influence African development? So the Academy Yam is a cluster of over 500 of Africa's top accomplished scientists. Broadly speaking, about ten clusters here. Many biomedical sciences, for example, physical science and engineering, policy sciences, agricultural sciences. So there are ten clusters altogether. And where my task is to help lead, if I may say it this way, africa's main science policy person, who advise both the African Union, its bilateral partners, as necessary, and the overall African development landscape. There are lots of emotions at the continent from the coup das in West Africa, and there's a divide between the English speaking African countries and the French speaking African countries. The colonial legacy, there's a divide there and there's a cultural aspect to it. So some people in Kenya don't understand why there's a coup in West Africa and some people in West Africa don't understand why Kenyans or Anglophones, those are the Commonwealth community don't understand why they're coup d'etas. But there are a lot of emotions going on about addressing the problems that the continent faces. Alex mentioned earlier, responding to Dimitri, that, you know.

Speaker B:
The audio is out again.

Speaker A:
Why not dialogue not understand? No, I'm sorry. When I get set to it, I'll get better into these. Every country, the world is dotted with think tanks that understand all this. How play. So no one is really that ignorant. They are intentional. And as time goes by, we will see how to African academies in this one think tank to do Africa's side of this global development program. So when I get well settled, as you mentioned, I would be able to provide. Nairobi happens to be one of the hubs, or maybe the main hub of Africa's wealth. It's a very wealthy city after Johannesburg and maybe Cairo. The top four cities on the continent is the driver of the East African economy. Has a very stable economy and political system now, having gone through transitions. So it's attracting lots of interest from outside. It is a hotbed. Many forums, many international activities. It is the destination point for lots of Africa's policy and economic discussions. So Nairobi is a place that think about going to know what is happening in Africa. Beyond safaris, the regular tourist aspect. Tourism is big in Africa. To understand Africa's policy, discourses and business agendas. Nairobi is one of those places to think about. Now that I'm here, I see it better. It's very different seeing things from a US academic office than coming here in a think tank and policy environment and being on the ground and having access to both the policy and the practitioners on the ground with their own perspectives and their own communities and their own aspirations. Not only intellectual, but very practical. So I look forward to sharing more on this. These are very useful. They're extremely useful in giving me a more global perspective on africa is closest to Asia. South. South Corporation means Africa's needs are closest to Asia than the western societies. The Asian Tigers came up. China has come out of nowhere in 30 years and done well. The ASEAN is akin to the African Union and African Economic Communities. So the models that some of us look forward to, to be inspired by, not to copy, but to be inspired by. They are mostly the Asian side because they've gone through post World War II challenges. Korea of no waste, the big power now. And Africa is trying to go that path. The global politics, the geopolitical side, the interest, the issue of sanctions and its effect or lack of effects, how militaries do the private sector bidding, all those dynamics. I learned lots of them from this forum and I'm very grateful. So I look forward to latching onto this, to do what I need to do for Africa.

Speaker B:
Thank you and Kim, it's great to see you there and we look forward to that. So we've run a bit over time, but I've asked Elvaro if now just trying to center us again, like he did so successfully last week. Elvaro, if you could share a final thought for us. Thank you.

Speaker A:
Thank you, sir. Without any shame, I will try to sell you something from the stage which should not be done because I thought back to the idea of harmony, respect and the problems we mentioned before. The idea of going backwards and said this is a lamentation, not a contribution, but I do have something to contribute and it is something which I feel very, very strongly it's in my head since already ten or 20 years and it is the separation of humanities and technology. When we think about this and speak about artificial intelligence, the prospects on first, I would like just to make you a very simple image. Have you ever met a sad computer? This should be giving you some thought. More than that. Since the Renaissance, when the technology and science went up so fast, all of the great scientists, the early ones, leonardo DA Vinci, Piero de la Francesca, the artist, even Vermeer, they were all people that considered themselves scientists and were thinking of selling art things in order to promote their science. One great example of a frustrated one is Johann Wolfganko von Gerte, the German literary genius. He considered himself and was very angry when people told him you're a literary genius. As a no, I'm a scientist. My theory of the colors is the important thing of contribution to humanity. Which was completely wrong, by the way. My theory about the original plant from which every other plants came and so on. To finish this, I would suggest almost a homework for those of you that would like to consider it. Go back and read a seminal book about this. It's a very small booklet called The Two Cultures. The Two Cultures was written by an Englishman in 1950. And Mr Snow, where he started to say we are now beginning to witness the separation, the complete lack of respect between science and art. An artist look as a scientist, somebody that can repair his toilet and scientists look, as an artist, as somebody painting graffiti on the subway outside of New York. That is the amount of lack of respect. Bringing these two together will certainly rebuild most of the problems that we have now. That booklet was sorry for trying it to say again the Two Cultures by Mr. Snow. You can read it in almost 3 hours. That is all. Feel sorry for exploiting and selling from the stage. It's very bad to do, but I could not resist.

Speaker B:
We appreciate it very much, I'm sure all of us do. And I will get reference to the book and put it in the notes. Thank you all. A very just discussion I'm sure we all have now to sit back and reflect on quite a bit. Have a great week, everybody, and look forward to seeing some of you in person in the coming week. And I look forward to seeing you next Saturday. Thank you very much. Have a great week.

Speaker G:
Thank you.

Speaker F:
Thank you.
