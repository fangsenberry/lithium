Overview

Scholars' and analysts' ability to predict is very poor. This month's main task is to use hindsight to summarize the mistakes and successful experiences from the past, so that we can move forward more steadily in the future. Our prediction function is poor and cannot be compared with that of the natural sciences. Of course, I know about natural sciences, such as climatology and meteorology, which are at a similar level to ours. It turns out that the father-in-law of a friend of mine is the chief engineer of the China Meteorological Administration. I once asked him; he said that the level of meteorological prediction is about the same as that of the old farmer who watches the sky, and he is at the same level of accuracy as us. But since I chose this topic, I will make a bold prediction because there must be one. Let me start, and then everyone can criticize. Then, through mutual criticism, can we find some reliable path?

Looking 10 years into the future

What about me? Well, for the sake of simplicity, I'll just say, what's the trend I think of in the next ten years? Divided into ten aspects, the first thing that comes to my mind is that the next ten years will determine international relations, or a big country? I think this is the first element. Relations between major countries still come first. Although we scholars like to talk about marginal topics, and we regard non-traditional security and other issues very highly, judging from historical experience, relations between major powers are still the most important to international relations.

Well, I predict that the relations between major countries in the next ten years will be more complicated than in the past ten years. This is a big judgment and more complicated. First, let me define it – it is difficult for big countries to define it. I am just saying that, from an empirical point of view, the 'big country' I am talking about here refers to these six countries and country groups, and this is China, the United States, Russia, and the European Union, whose operational capabilities are equivalent to that of a big country, then Japan, then India.

Brazil is not considered a big country. Brazil is big enough to become a big country. But, it is a pity that its upward mobility is relatively poor. This I have learned from visiting Brazil twice, and what my Brazilian friends have said – God must be Brazilian. They say this because they love Brazil so much. Then, if you talk to Brazilians about being hungry and cold, they don’t understand. They rarely feel hungry and can eat whatever they want; the product is so rich. As for the weather, they don’t feel cold.A Brazilian friend of mine first came to China and arrived in Beijing in January. We advised him to wear more clothes, and he agreed. However, he only brought three pairs of long-sleeved shirts. As soon as he exited Beijing airport, he was freezing, so I had to quickly buy him a down jacket—usually, he wears shorts. When I reminded him about extra clothing, he said, "I brought three pairs of long sleeves; that’s not bringing extra clothes, right?" Even though the conditions in their place are excellent, they face some problems. They are unorganized, and their organizational skills are very poor, yet human progress depends on these skills.

The power of a moderator can be measured by the degree of development. The literary teacher who went to Taiwan to give a lecture had a more grounded point of view, stating, "Guangtu Giant Clan," right? I believe this perspective is very insightful and belongs to the linguistic concepts of Chinese social sciences, which can bolster the theoretical framework. Developing organizational skills, particularly for the loess crew, was challenging, but they improved significantly. Unfortunately, Brazil lacks in this area. It's as though God truly cherishes his 85 million square kilometers of land, which costs nothing. I flew across Brazil twice and was incredibly envious. The Huangtu (loess) plains were not a secret; unlike Beijing, en route to Europe, you can see nothing but yellow and barren land for half an hour. Within that time, can you spot any greenery? All you see below is yellow and barren in Brazil, but that’s not the case. You can't see the yellow; you can't see the deforestation here because the largest lungs of the world, the Amazon forest, are located in Brazil. The Amazon River serves as the real kidneys of Earth. The extent to which the Amazon and its water are distributed is astonishing. During its dry season, the water volume is eight times that of our Yangtze River. In the wet season, the expanse of water is so vast it resembles the sea, just because you can't see either side. So, although Brazil is a large country, it's a shame that its lack of organizational ability prevents it from being considered a great nation.Therefore, the big countries here are these six: China, the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan, and India. What do I personally think about the objective conditions? Well, the objective competition conditions between China and the United States should be better than those between Russia, Europe, and Japan in the next ten years. Hey, Russia's population is small, right? There are 142 million people. It seems that the population is still shrinking now. It's not shrinking as fast as Japan, but it is still shrinking. This reminds me of a statistic: a Russian girl today only gives birth to 0.67 children in her lifetime. Haha, that's so selfish. Our girls are okay, but now, on average, it seems to be 1.2. So we are okay; they are at 0.7. Europe is also aging now and has problems with unity. Japan has an absolute population decrease, right? Last year, there was a decrease of 360,000 people. 

So, from the perspective of population and resource situations, as well as national organization and mobilization capabilities, among these six, the conditions in China, Russia, and India are better. This is an objective judgment. But subjectively? What about the Six Nations and the Group of Six in the future? In fact, they behave in similar ways. They all have to take care of internal affairs first. If there is no internal stability, everything will be over, so managing internal affairs well is the top priority. Then, secondly, countries should try to improve relations with other continents. Hey, I hope the relationship of other major countries with us will be closer than the relationships between themselves. This is what I think. And are these two things done well? It's international relations. That is to say, after internal affairs are handled well and international relations are strategized, then countries can advance their own international agendas. So everyone should actually behave in the same way. The subjective behavior methods involve all three points: internal, then external relations, and then advancing their own agenda.

So, generally speaking, in the future, relationships between major powers will be very complicated, and mutual suspicion among them should be deepened. So what about China? Well, China-Russia relations and China-EU relations should generally be stable in the future. What will be more difficult for us to deal with are the three types of relations between China and the United States, China and Japan, China and India. The relation above should be very difficult to handle. From the perspective of the United States, as China's power converges with its own in the future, the U.S. will become more and more nervous.And what about our reaction? It will become less and less calm. I have been studying the United States since 1984. Now, at 33 years old, my personal experience is that the United States is changing. It has entered menopause. It used to be quite good-tempered. The United States was very confident and quite cute, but its confidence had a downside—it liked to boss around. However, overall, it was easy to deal with. Becoming more confident meant it was tolerant and humorous, and it wasn’t a problem if one scolded it; it would make fun of itself.

Now, the United States is becoming like India—very sensitive, right? It enjoys flattery and is pleased when you speak well of it. If you scold it, it gets angry. The sense of humor is gone, and it is not as easy to deal with as before. So, I guess this will be the case in the future. China is converging in power with the United States. Then, with the United States in a bad temper, the relationship will be quite difficult.

Japan, what about Japan? I personally think that it is the most difficult country in the world to accept the rise of China. This is because Japan harbors two attitudes that other countries do not. One is a sense of stupid racism towards China. The other is a very deep sense of guilt. These attitudes are not found in other countries. Surely, Japan's racism must be traced back to the past hundred years or so.

What about Japan's route to development? Did it learn from the West, leave Asia, and join Europe? Japan adopted one thing from the West: the industrial system. It mastered modern manufacturing and industrialized. And how well has it done? It not only ranks first among Asian countries but also among 180 non-Western countries and regions around the world.

As for us in China, for a time, we foolishly rejected industrialization, mainly due to the late Qing Dynasty in the 1970s. The government and the opposition here strove to learn and did so very effectively, but at that point, they foolishly refused, leading to dire consequences. The result was industrial Japan versus agricultural China. In 1937, Japan fully invaded China, which, from an international political perspective, was a direct act of aggression.From a historical perspective, the industry has actually attacked agriculture. His meeting unfolds in one way, and your perspective is different. So what outcome does such a historical context lead to? It leads to Japan forming a very obvious comprehensive industrial and technological advantage over China, right? Japan has maintained this advantage for over a hundred years. This is a fact that must be respected and acknowledged, and we should learn to humbly correct it. But the issue arises with the next step: Japanese theorists, politicians, and strategists have erroneously interpreted their technological lead as the perpetual superiority of Japanese civilization over Chinese civilization. This represents a sneakily shifted concept, you know? And what about some individuals? Their views are quite bad and narrow-minded. They have taken this to mean that the Japanese are inherently superior to the Chinese, fostering racism, which has become deeply entrenched.

During this process, numerous cultural falsehoods were concocted. Dangdang, among others, created many of these cultural lies. Consequently, a host of naïve intellectuals in China have perpetuated these fabrications for a century. One such cultural lie claims the Japanese believe that Chinese people are inherently careless and sloppy. I agree that Chinese people can sometimes be careless. However, after spending time in the United States, I found Americans exhibited similar behaviors. My trips to Russia and other countries like Brazil and India revealed the same thing: carelessness was not unique to any one group; it was a universal trait. Yet, China, which I consider to be among the better large nations, is singled out by the Japanese as having an exclusive problem with carelessness. Clearly, this is incorrect.

It's disappointing that Chinese intelligentsia perpetuate these misconceptions, deeming themselves foolish. This is the Japanese narrative. But what's the stupidity in the Chinese response? Some people are aware but continue to propagate these ideas for their own ends, and that is both foolish and wrong. Another cultural lie suggests that the Chinese are disunited, which has greatly impacted China’s intellectual and political spheres. Even Mr. Sun, Mr. Zhongshan— the father of the Republic of China—regarded this judgment as correct.

My worldview has been shaped by extensive travel—I've been to the United States over a hundred times and have visited approximately seventy other countries and regions. These visits led me to conclude that, in comparison with the global average, we are more united than most.Well, for example, take Africa. You're familiar with the massacre in Rwanda, right? Tutsis and Hutus. They massacred 13 million people in four months. They belong to another race. That tribal conflict was incredibly cruel. It turns out that during the colonial era, colonists went to Africa to capture slaves, right? The main occurrence was that various tribes would capture each other and sell the captives to Europeans, as opposed to it being mainly the Europeans capturing them directly. This illustrates the extent of the cruelty, doesn't it? 

Then, look at the Middle East, North Africa, and West Asia, where the contradictions are too profound, right? There, you have ethnic conflicts among Persians, Arabs, Kurds, and others. It's so cruel. And within their sect, the Shia and Sunni, right? Such profound contradictions. I heard an Arabic proverb that says if you encounter Persians and poisonous snakes in the desert, you must kill the Persians first, right? 

Moving on to South Asia, consider Pakistan and India. They actually used to be one civilized entity. In fact, they are all a mix of black and white, and fundamentally the same, yet now you see their animosity is as intense as fire and water, right? 

Well then, you might say that Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia should not be compared with each other, but rather with Europe. What about Europe? We consider ourselves far better than the Slavs, right? Look, everyone knows that the Slavic people are divided into three groups, don't they? For West Slavia, the representative is Poland. For East Slavia, it's Russia, right? Do they harbour hatred towards each other? Particularly the hatred of Poles towards Russia. Everyone should have read Zbigniew Brzezinski's book — that's Brzezinski, not Brezinski — "The Grand Chessboard." It covers this topic because he himself is Polish and understands this nation's sentiments. He mentioned that the Poles' hatred for Russians is ingrained from the womb. It's innate, such that they hate before they can even speak. 

Now if we look at a smaller scale, it's the East Slavs. The East Slavs consist of three 'brothers': Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine. Observe Ukraine now, and see how deep their hatred for Russia is, right? But from a scientific standpoint, is it necessary to compare oneself with a psychopath? It's not necessary. That's not scientific. 

Yes, ok, this is off-topic, but the point is that the Japanese are actually...He has been fighting against China for the past 100 years. He is Japanese with a bit of a mental disorder, but he actually knows in his heart that China is his cultural adoptive mother. If you are interested in traveling to Japan, don't just buy things. Don't just spend 12,000 yuan to buy a toilet seat. That's too stupid, right? You Shanghainese spend 20,000 yuan to travel, travel money to Japan, and then spend 12,000 yuan on a toilet seat, right? Then I discovered that it was produced in the suburbs of Hangzhou. Are you just stupid? Is this a standard modern idiotic freshness?

Well, then what? Uh, if you go in the future, go to Ueno Park to see the Japan National Museum of History. Hey, you will find out Japan entered the dynasty from the Kofun Period in 702. Very late. He only entered from a tribe into a dynasty in the eighth century, right? And then, uh, what he accepted was the Doctor of the Five Classics? Doctors of the Five Classics came from the Korean Peninsula, so its culture started from studying Confucianism, and then it added Han Buddhism to Mahayana Buddhism. This is Japan. Even Japan has evolved from barbarians and tribes to civilization. It learned from us. We are the foster mother of its culture.

So after modernization, when they come up, they will attack us. He knows it in his heart, so in order to convince himself and to shock the Chinese, he wants to humiliate you. You know, he wants to make you extremely miserable so that he can get rid of you, and he can find comfort for himself. So why did he go to Nanjing? Then everyone has already surrendered after the massacre. There is this kind of collective mentality behind such a humiliating massacre.

OK, so, uh, this is going a bit far. Organization is a big conclusion. As for Japan, it did do well in industrialization for a period of time, but after doing well, it began to make mistakes. This mistake is the two leaps of reasoning I just talked about. You know, describing a period of technological advantages as eternal advantages of civilization, and then turning them into human advantages. Hey, this is definitely wrong in theory, right? But they have a very deep-rooted attitude toward China, which is called racial superiority. This sense of superiority prevents them from accepting the rise of China.In fact, today they have begun to face difficulties because of China's technological advances. As for their existence, there is a premise. Well, according to my understanding, this technical advantage is part of a broader knowledge advantage. This can include technology and institutions, right? Including a narrow sense of knowledge, it is part of the broad knowledge advantage, and everyone must be clear about this knowledge advantage. It is completely repairable through the learning process. Japan's technological superiority has been predicated on the Chinese foolishly refusing to learn. But as long as the Chinese start to learn, it will only be a matter of time before they technically catch up. It will be a matter of one day sooner or one day later.

You know, as China now starts to industrialize seriously, we are catching up step by step. Hey, now a few things have caught up, and they are now embedded in the confusion of the whole people. If you talk to the Japanese now, they can’t understand what has happened. First, they originally thought they were the greatest electronic empire—uh, they should be perfect, right, invincible. But now Sony says, "You can't find us, right?" You are still here, and you have become our, Huawei’s, wage earner. So, Huawei's accessories supplier.

Another case is a Japanese scholar. My high-speed rail is called the Shinkansen in Japan, right? Does he think I am the only one in the world? No one can beat my high-speed rail. But now he clearly knows that our high-speed rail is better than his. There are three major high-speed rail systems in the world: France, Japan, and China. We are the best, you know? The Shinkansen has a top speed of 246 kilometers per hour while the French Eurostar has a top speed of 272 kilometers per hour. Well, if our distance is less than 300 kilometers, I’m embarrassed to call it a high-speed rail, right? We call it the EMU. According to Chinese standards, Japan doesn't have a high-speed rail, right? Why would you have the nerve to call 246 kilometers per hour a high-speed rail? It's not scientific.

Now the entire Japanese populace is confused. They think that I, you, and others are also confused when they see China now, he said. This is wrong; what's wrong? It seems like he said, "You shouldn't be able to do it—why can you do it?" This is unscientific. He is very confused. In fact, he does not realize the fragility of his technological advantage. You see, the premise for the existence of his technological advantage requires the Chinese to make mistakes.Once the error is corrected, the technical advantage quickly disappears, and that's what we're seeing now. "Hey, this is Japan, it's here now, and it's particularly painful; it is more painful there than in other countries, which is why it has set a trap for itself. Hey, there's also a unique Japanese psychology; it entails a profound understanding of us and a sense of guilt. He definitely realizes that modern history has wronged us, right? They attacked us during the Sino-Japanese War and then fully invaded China, right? This was particularly cruel. Of course, he fears that we will get stronger and seek revenge on him. It's somewhat akin to that of a drug trafficker. Drug traffickers know that what they're caught for is a capital crime, right? So, the criminals expect to be beaten when the police arrive, right? We typically let a small-scale police officer come in. I believe this is very honest. He just nods and bows, right? A drug trafficker must expect a beating, right? Because it's a capital crime, right? Alas, Japan itself feels that it has committed a particularly serious capital offense. Hey, in fact, he must realize by now that among the larger countries, China is particularly good-hearted, right? As long as the Japanese acknowledge their mistake, everything will be settled, but they currently do not concede their error. Consequently, Sino-Japanese relations will definitely be problematic over the next ten years. They themselves are not very clear about these two aspects of collective psychology. Yes, I am aware of this mentality, but it does exist and is widespread. It is tough to eradicate.

Regarding India, there will undoubtedly be major trouble in the future. We have actual problems with border conflicts, right? And then, objectively, we have all risen at the same time, correct? There is a situation of strategic competition. So, in short, this is my feeling. In future relations between major powers, there will be no problem between China and Europe, and there will be no problem between China and Russia. But with these three—the United States, Japan, and India—there must be trouble.

OK, this is a bit of a story. I didn’t manage my time well; I should go faster. The second major trend is that the world is moving towards two superpowers. Unlike the multipolarization we recommended before, it is not about two superpowers with multiple powers by design; it is my logic. It is under the condition that China maintains domestic political stability.Our economic development is faster than that of most large countries. This is because, with rapid economic development, our comprehensive national strength will steadily increase, right? So, in the next ten years, I estimate that we should be keeping distance from other major countries. Like Japan, Germany, and Russia, the gap between them and us must be either narrowing or widening. 

As for the Chinese economy, there is a secret to our development. We have two wheels and two engines. One of these is the market. There are groups of Chinese people who are inherently skilled in market practices. Especially in our area, the Yangtze River Delta in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. You know, there are some Chinese whose ancestral home is in Zhejiang, right? Among us are four cousins, and everyone is wealthier than I am. They see me as quite pitiful. With vitamins—I have some—everyone has sympathy and understanding. They are actually natural-born entrepreneurs, and they feel very confident.

Then, we also have such people in the Pearl River Delta, as well as in the central reaches of the Yangtze River. Of course, there are other places as well. There are many talented entrepreneurs in China. This nation is capable of playing the market economy, and it can play it well.

What else? Chinese local governments are considered the second engine. Each party secretary of the local government is essentially a CEO, thinking about how to attract investment all day long. So the Chinese economy actually has two wheels. In the past two years, one wheel has caught fire a bit, that is, the local government wheel. But I estimate that this wheel will restart after the 19th National Congress, and we will return to two-wheel drive. Therefore, our economy will become even faster.

So if you have been able to survive in your business over the past few years, there should be more opportunities after the 19th National Congress. However, the United States operates on a one-wheel drive—the market. The market in the United States is very strong. This must be acknowledged. Well, in fact, the future will be more troublesome and larger for Russia. Russia does not know how to engage in the market economy; he doesn’t know how to do it, so he doesn’t know how to play. He was born to play a planned economy, but he doesn’t have the conditions for a planned economy anymore. Does this planned economy not need a strong Central Committee, a strong Discipline Inspection Commission, and strong state-owned enterprises? They are gone now; they no longer exist.So now he mainly relies on selling resources, right? Russia relied on oil exports for 50% of its fiscal revenue last year, and 80% of its exports were oil. The entire country has fallen into a resource trap, and that one is very fragile. In this sense, Americans do not think highly of Russia economically. Some American media call Russia "the Saudi Arabia with nuclear weapons." Er, OK, this is a basic judgment; it is China. Well, of course, there is a major premise, which is domestic political stability. If that is gone, then this premise is gone, right? 

I have a premise that domestic policies must be stable, but under the premise that the economy is good, and if the economy is good, China's national strength will develop well in the future. In this way, China will distance itself from other big countries, other big countries apart from the United States, and then it will gradually close the gap with the United States. Because of this, as China and the United States get closer, the final pattern of the world will shift from one superpower to two superpowers; this is a judgment. 

Then we will talk about it. To be more specific, the main platform for world governance in the future will be the G20. The G7 will still exist, but its effectiveness will decline, right? It is subject to global governance. In the near future, the G20 might replace the G7. Well, it may not necessarily replace it. It may not, but the role of the G7 will diminish, while the influence of the G20 will become dominant. This is one point, and then there is China.

If China's promotion is successful, its comprehensive national strength will become stronger. Therefore, some new international mechanisms promoted by China will become even more important. For example, the AIIB, the NDB, the CICA Conference, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization - uh, China is actually still promoting another bank, which is the SCO Bank, and we are still promoting it. There is another rumor that China will take over the Group of 77, which has a South-South Cooperation Bank that has existed for almost 60 years and is in dire need of an effective leader. Well, then China may be considering transforming this one. OK, these are some mechanisms promoted by China.

There are also some initiatives, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, and some concepts, such as a community with a shared future for mankind and a global partnership network. Mechanisms like those of China will become more active, and these innovative concepts will have a greater impact.OK, this is the second biggest trend, right? We are moving towards two superpowers. As for the third one, in the next ten years, internet celebrities from medium-power countries will emerge. We need to pay more attention to them and love them because the role they will play is going to be bigger. In my mind, the four major powers we should pay special attention to in the next ten years are Vietnam, Indonesia, Iran, and Türkiye.

Vietnam's industrialization should be done well. I've been to Vietnam twice. It was called Saigon before, but when I went, it had been renamed to Ho Chi Minh City. It's like noon at three o'clock in the evening there; it's so lively. There was this hard-working woman; she's really industrious. Initially, I thought the man next to her was a bit lazy, drinking tea and snoring, but she was very hard-working. It is this country that has the potential to industrialize. And the population? More than 90 million, which will soon exceed 100 million, right? Where the population base exists, there is industrial capacity. It seems that the results of the International Mathematical Olympiad were released the day before yesterday or last week, right? South Korea was first, China second, and Vietnam third. Is that the one? Well, it must be; I think it's a pretty powerful indicator. The diplomatic strategy is also very strong. It is not easy for Vietnam; the task is very difficult, so this is particularly important.

And then there's Indonesia. In Indonesia, the population is large to begin with, right? Location will also be important. With the rise of China and India, being in the vicinity of these two future rising powers, Indonesia will experience spillover effects and can benefit from the fact that the strategic focus of the United States is returning here. Right, from now on, these three countries will be very influential. Indonesia can take advantage of its large population and good resources. The necessary conditions are favorable, and everyone will try to get a piece. Therefore, its external environment is also a mix, and it is estimated to hold a lot of promise.

Indonesia’s internal problems, however, are more significant than others'. Is the leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam a land reformer? After the map changes, land reform will be very beneficial to the country's industrialization. Land reform is an essential part of a country's modernization. In many Southeast Asian countries, as well as African, Latin American, and South Asian countries, the first obstacle to modernization is the lack of land reform, which leads to uneven distribution of wealth, you know.Well, there are very rich people in this country, and their family owns 90% of the real estate. He is very rich, but he has taken his money from the international market and given it to a hedge fund in the United States to make excess profit. They don't invest in their own country. You know, this country has money, but it is not controlled by the country itself. Instead, they invest it outside, making their family richer, while the entire country remains poor and lacks funds for modernization. It was not easy to introduce foreign investment and develop even a little industry because everyone is poor, except for him. He is caught in a vicious cycle. However, after he made corrections, it was different. Following the land reform, wealth was distributed more evenly, and the society itself became wealthier. Yet, industrialization is conditional.

Indonesia faces greater internal challenges than Vietnam. However, in a general sense, its conditions are quite good given its sizable population, resources, and favorable external environment, so we should not underestimate it.

Then there's also Iran. Oh, Iran should be considered in this context. First, it has a long civilization. Some people believe that its five thousand years of history are accurate and that many of the five thousand years of Chinese history are myths. They argue we are really closer to over four thousand or three thousand years. He claims to be genuinely five thousand years old, with a very rich cultural heritage. This nation has a large population, doesn't it? It must be quite substantial, with more than 16 million people on its land, which is not an insignificant number. Moreover, it's rare to find a country in the Muslim world with its own industry and a certain industrial base.

As for now, the overall situation in Iran is not bad. Frankly, with Iran's rise, I believe the United States is the first project, not Iran itself. The United States is the first concern; Iran comes second. Why do I say the United States? There was a time when Iran had a difficult period, particularly after the Green Revolution in 1979 and the subsequent upheavals. He was very pitiable because the entire West disliked him. He didn't just hold the United States hostage; he held the entire West, as well as the entire Sunni world, hostage. Then, with the backing of the West and Saudi Arabia, Saddam launched an attack against him.The Iran-Iraq war lasted for eight and a half years, during which more than 46 million people died in Iran, resulting in a very miserable situation. We were beaten militarily, isolated politically, and faced severe economic difficulties due to the second oil crisis that came 79 years later after the first oil crisis of 1973. Once Western countries began to industrialize, and following the two oil crises in 1979, the price of oil started to decrease. Since Iran relies heavily on oil, this period was financially challenging for a long time. The combination of being defeated in terms of security and being isolated politically was indeed pitiful.

However, in this century, with assistance from the Americans, Iran is now turning things around and coming back to life. The first thing the United States did was eliminate its old enemy, Saddam Hussein. When it comes to democracy in Iraq, it is determined by the majority. The Shiites, supported by Iran, emerged victorious because they make up 60% of Iraq's population, with Sunnis and Kurds each comprising 20%. Consequently, Iran now effectively controls the situation in Iraq. This control allows for a connection with the Syrian government, which is also Shiite. On connecting with Syria, this links to Hezbollah, which is Shia. As a result, Iran, which was once secluded in the Persian Gulf, now extends its influence to the Mediterranean. Without opposition from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, Iran now faces much less security pressure.

Diplomatically, the situation has changed again. Additionally, due to the recent increase in oil prices, Iran's economy has recovered. Thus, Iran is in a much stronger position now than it was ten years ago, and its future looks promising. So why is Israel particularly concerned? It is because Iran is likely the only country in the Muslim world capable of posing a real threat to Israel in the future; the other countries simply lack that capability. Hence, Israel is particularly wary of Iran. Consequently, the United States, influenced by Israel, now seeks to address the situation with Iran. However, I believe that Iran will continue to become an independent force in the Middle East and play a significant role there. We should be optimistic about this country's prospects.

Finally, Türkiye is the most important among the middle powers, and we need to pay attention to it. Turkey's Erdogan is incredibly ambitious.He wants to promote what is called neo-Ottomanism, led by Dr. Altman. Neo-Ottomanism, well, will position the country as an agent of significant changes in the Middle East. This is the third trend which requires close attention to these four middle powers because they will play a more prominent role. What about Brazil? In fact, as I mentioned, the consideration is for a large country, but it plays the role of a middle power. Other middle powers worthy of attention include South Korea and Myanmar. Then, Kazakhstan, and on a weekly basis, Mexico and Argentina should become more important. Additionally, Egypt and Israel must be monitored. However, the most crucial ones are the ones I listed earlier: Vietnam, Indonesia, Iran, and Turkey. This is the third major trend for the future.

As for the fourth major trend, this region will become more divided. In the next ten years, I estimate that North America and Australia will be very stable from the perspective of international relations. These two will be the true islands of stability in the world. Then there's Europe and Middle East Asia which should be considered relatively stable islands. Despite many conflicts in both places, our management capabilities are robust enough to maintain stability. The future of the Middle East, however, will certainly be more chaotic than the past ten years. The Shia and Sunni factions will engage in even fiercer battles. There's also a new variable to consider—the Kurds, right? Coupled with Turkey and Iran, as mentioned earlier, they will be more active, making the Middle East even more volatile.

I think Africa may fare better. Africa will be better off than in the past decade. Of course, the continent doesn't yet have the capacity to develop itself economically or to control its own security. It needs support from the international community which, although previously ineffective, will now begin to have some positive impact. Thus, Africa, to some extent, will be in a better position than the Middle East, with the situation in Africa being relatively better. And, frankly speaking, Africa's relative improvement is largely due to China's contributions, which have been substantial. For instance, now when people visit Ethiopia, they comment on how the country is a hive of construction sites bedecked with cranes, displaying two signs—the one on top is in Chinese, and the one underneath is in the local script.That situation is good; job opportunities are increasing. The situation in the region is such that America and Australia are the most stable. Asia and East Asia rank second in stability, while the Middle East is more chaotic. Africa is faring better, whereas Central Asia is grappling with internal power transfer issues. For instance, the president of Kazakhstan has been in office for more than 20 years and will probably continue into the future. As he ages, conditional issues regarding rights will emerge. Latin America has always faced difficulties with internal political stability. However, to be honest, the spillover effect from Latin America is not significant. Even when events unfold there, they seem to garner little international concern.

The situation in South Asia heavily depends on India's trajectory. It is currently unclear whether India will maintain its growth momentum and use its emerging power wisely. I believe India will continue to face challenges in the future. The biggest difficulty for India is that its society requires reform. Economically, things are still okay, with international capital showing optimism about its potential, affecting where massive amounts of "hot money" flow and where international investments are directed. The foreign investment India receives is nearly equivalent to ours, each amounting to more than 100 billion US dollars. However, 100 billion dollars would have a substantial impact on India, considering its GDP stands at 2.22 trillion US dollars. In contrast, our GDP is 11.12 trillion US dollars, which is slightly more than five times greater.

By the way, in the Yangtze River Delta region, our GDP last year within Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu was 2.4 trillion US dollars, 200 billion more than India. That places it sixth, ahead of India. Naturally, this is in an economically and politically unified context, which is invariably strong. Our structure here is many times more advanced than that of India. India's structure is significantly lagging. Thus, while 100 billion dollars might not create a substantial impact here, it would significantly affect India.

The biggest problem in India, in my opinion, is still the social structure. The entire social structure in India revolves around money, and although it has adapted to modernity in its political structure—with modern rule of law and democracy—its social structure remains pre-modern, which is its real issue. It needs to undergo societal reforms, including land reform, which is exceedingly difficult.I don't know if he can overcome this. This article will provide you with a breakdown of a relatively common consensus on the Internet. Currently, our website and the entire public opinion in the West are particularly optimistic about India, right? Those who think highly of India, love it, or are even obsessed with it, can be termed 'Indophiles', correct? Similar to those who are obsessed with Japan and purchase specialized toilet seats, who are called 'Japophiles,' correct? The Japanese are heavily promoted; they are all aboard and considered eccentric for doing so.

Regarding India, there are three common views. First, India has English, which is beneficial for internationalization. Second, India is democratic and thus politically stable. Third, India's population is younger than ours. These are the three main reasons. However, in reality, all three reasons can be questioned. What about English? For this country, using external experiences as a tool is beneficial, but it is not that important because those familiar with international relations know that the Japanese aren't proficient in English, right? Take, for example, the word 'computer' in Japanese, which is always pronounced 'computer,' right?

There's a historical example in international relations when the standard of pronunciation was crucial—the Paris Peace Conference a hundred years ago. Our national spokesperson was Gu Weijun, a renowned diplomat, right? Did he have dual master's degrees from Columbia University, one in business and the other in law? At that time, possessing a double master's degree was a significant achievement. He was charismatic, and his English was fluent. He received a round of applause when he spoke because he was so articulate.

Then, the Japanese representative spoke, and after he finished, there was no applause because no one understood him, do you see? The meeting's host was an American. At that time, the United States took a more favorable and accommodating stance. He shook his hand and commented that the Japanese representative's speech sounded very much like English. The representative from Japan admitted that his teacher spoke only English. This is the reality of the situation. Thus, the Japanese language capability may not be strong, but Japan’s modernization process has been very successful, hasn't it? It has not hindered their progress.Hey, this is one—the language is not good, but it does not have much impact. A counter-example is Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is also one of the 53 members of the Commonwealth, and it was under British rule. Then I told everyone that basically, all the people in Zimbabwe speak English because the local indigenous languages are considered too backward to adapt to modern life. Universally, they speak English. In fact, in India, there are more than 100 million people who speak English every day, including the little ones at home who have been speaking English since childhood. Is it a very low proportion—do most Indians speak Hindi? As for other languages, everyone knows there are 15 languages on the rupee. They are all official languages and are all spoken by the people, which is quite popular. Therefore, the real English-speaking population in India is not as high as one might think. So, the English-speaking population ratio in India is not high. Of course, it is true that India really speaks English very well. It goes without saying that it is much better than us, because its inherent advantage is that the main ancestor of all European languages is Sanskrit. You know, the Indo-European language family—the ancestor of all modern European languages is so influential—so when Indians speak, they are always right, because they are the progenitors. You know, even if it seems wrong, it is right, so there is a bit of this grammar that is innate, and it is always correct. It's just because he is the grandfather—he is always right, you know? Consequently, he has a little bit of an innate advantage, so once he speaks, it is very standard, very good. But what I just said about his actual English speaking population ratio—it is not as high as we thought.

Well, basically, everyone in Zimbabwe speaks English, right? But everyone knows that Zimbabwe has created a miracle in economic history. This is why Zimbabwe has the highest inflation rate in the world, right? The Ministry of Economy and Trade has no source of gold. Now, it uses US dollars, euros, and renminbi as its national currency. Then, the moment it abolished the gold-backed dollar—do you know how much the money inflated? Just 100 million US dollars were equivalent to 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars. It cannot be surpassed. I think this is the pinnacle of mankind.

Well, so you see that this person is good at English, but that does not necessarily mean they are good at economics, right? My English is not good there, but I can do okay. So, English is not actually an absolute variable, you know. Hey, this can be ruled out. There is another one.Everyone likes to talk about what democracy is in India, right? Well, this is actually the case. If you look at the history of the United Kingdom, you'll see how the modern democracy of the British people came about. In ancient times, it had an aristocratic republic but not a democracy. Democracy is modern and it started with industrialization. What about the population? Let's work together. 

In the past, everyone knew that production was done by each household, in their own yard. It was called a courtyard in English, right? It was the yard where the grandfather, his son, and his grandson made things together. Later, it was still called a courtyard. Are there only factories? That's why everyone is so labor-intensive because they have big machines. There are big machines, and production is concentrated in one place. Then, people just ran from the countryside to one place, to certain places. At this time, a period criticized by Marx appeared, where sheep cannibalized people. Yang Siren, in fact, stated that capital is a process of driving people away from their land. This is a problem that he wants to create that mobile labor force. 

This is the first stage of credit in the UK. He started this, and they have big machines for production. Everyone produces because their production volume is very large, so people need to be concentrated there. So at this time, Kotya didn't even exist, but there was this one, now it's called a factory. Factory workers, in the modern sense, began to gather in places, and then there was urbanization. It was based on this economic need, and then urbanization.

After urbanization, when everyone has accumulated to a certain extent, democracy will start. Why? Everyone has left the countryside, and the protection of ordinary life is very weak. Then they will have demands for democratization. Then, when democratization begins, there will be no rules. If there is chaos, those who have the most will bully others. There will be the rule of law. So, India's modern democracy is the product of industrialization and urbanization — not the premise, you know? Then, India was colonized by the British in reverse. People transplanted this modern democracy and the modern rule of law from outside. Its industrialization and urbanization are still in progress. This leads to the result that its democratization is actually an obstacle to its industrialization and urbanization, rather than being a positive help, right? Well, to be frank, the third thing that the Indians can really use is the large population that India will have in the future.You know, the only thing that India has surpassed China in is its population. This is the more obvious one. The next question comes: having a large population is not necessarily a good thing for a modern country. Your foundation is modern manufacturing. Modern manufacturing is determined by your industrial population, not your overall population.

In 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China. There were 60 million people on the main island of Japan, and 500 million people on our side. We were outnumbering them eight to one, but we couldn't beat them, right? The Nationalist Government fought heroically, and the Communist Party joined in the war of resistance. We were very brave. But then, we lost half of our country, right? That is because industrialization is actually determined by industrial population, not just population, you know?

Well, India has a big challenge, which is to cultivate its burgeoning population for modern industry. Oh, there are three variables here that need to be resolved. As for the modern industrial population, it has three variables. First, the individuals must be motivated. This requires them to be willing to make progress and have a desire to work. Second, and very important, you must have working skills. You must have a desire to work, and secondly, you must work. Skill in work is essential because jobs are becoming more and more complex. If you just think that you are undisciplined and can only move bricks, this is not suitable for modernization, you know? You must be able to communicate, understand technology, manage, and have working skills. 

Third, you must have work ethic and discipline for this work. This, uh, human modernization, from one perspective, is the process of continuous improvement of human efficiency. There are two paths to improving human efficiency: one is called technological innovation; the other is scientific management. Well, both avenues can improve efficiency. However, scientific management requires those involved in management, er, those involved in such work, to accept the division of labor and discipline, right? If you don't accept discipline and point out that labor cannot be divided effectively here and there, then the division of labor is impeded, right? So you must have this to participate effectively.

Frankly speaking, can India turn its young workforce into one that meets these three standards? It's hard to say because it has a heavy religious component, right? Well, it is also different from the West in that places like the Mediterranean have what are called monotheistic religions. This may be the Jewish Yahweh, Jehovah, the Catholic God, or Allah as God.Anyway, all of these are monotheistic religions. Then, in that place—in South Asia—it is polytheistic; therefore, there are many gods, right? Some people have exaggeratedly talked about there being 360 million gods, right? He has to be here every day for the rest of his life to count his wife. There are too many of these and that, so his surname is Loop, which means he can endure it, right? He said, "If you bully me in this life, I will bully you in the next life," so he is not worried about that.

Well, in fact, before industrialization, our human civilization was mainly a mature civilization on our Eurasian continent, right? Africa and Latin America have civilizations, but they are not as mature. Mature civilizations are here, and we were able to industrialize because of them. Previous civilizations were roughly divided into three directions. Well, one was the Mediterranean civilization circle. They are monotheistic, looking to the future because they have a complete personality. And for people to live in reality, they must learn where to go.

So, there is another civilization that looks to the future—that is, the South Asian civilization circle. It is polytheistic, looks at the past, and always finds itself in a loop. Another one is the Chinese Civilization Circle, which focuses on the present. You know, if you hit me and I, as a Chinese, don't suffer, I will definitely retaliate against you. The one who calculates very well is okay, but what about us Chinese? Let me tell you, our ambition is too strong, right? 

Hey, this has made our lives very competitive and cruel. Now, we compete right from the womb. He said that the children were given that Mozart sticker, right? Then, they go to the best kindergarten. Ah, after coming in, they scramble for that little red flower. The so-called kid has been a weirdo since childhood, right? We have to fight for the little red flower every day until we reach the grave; that is what I want to tell you. 

I can be too strong for three hours; it’s not a matter of not having a wall. In addition, we are working in this place, so our skills are not a problem. The Chinese cultural circle places the highest importance on education in the world—except for the Jewish civilization, no other civilization can compare with ours. Mr. Cao, we value education highly here. As long as it is within the Chinese civilization visa, there will be school district housing. Now you are getting richer and richer, and so is everyone else. Look at Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea.Because North Korea is not market-oriented at present, you can't see it. Everything there is driven by the market. Let's do it correctly, right? Furthermore, in Vietnam, the price of a house can double if it's just one block away from a good school district. This is a significant cultural phenomenon. It appears that the economy is often influenced by cultural values. Other groups who highly value cultural education include Jews. Without this, nothing else seems to work. Hence, most children in China receive a good education and possess excellent work skills. However, I am uncertain whether India can achieve this due to the current low literacy rate and high illiteracy rate. 

The standards for literacy in India are remarkably uniform. Amusingly, the currency there is the rupee, and there are 15 languages. If you can sign your name in any of these languages, you're considered literate. That's how simple it is. With such a low standard, an adult at the age of 45 will not be classified as illiterate. Isn't that frightening? So, how do you prepare the new workforce with the necessary work skills? This is indeed a significant challenge, right? 

Moreover, the desire to work must contend with religious beliefs, and the improvement in work skills necessitates an enhanced education system. Additionally, there must be adherence to work discipline, which can be difficult due to lax attitudes, existing traditions, and inherent contradictions. In summary, if India's future workforce cannot overcome these three issues—work desire, work skill, and work discipline—it will be a financial burden rather than an asset. Is that not so? 

By the way, I believe children within the Chinese cultural sphere inherently possess these three traits, thus they are naturally suited to be diligent workers. There is evidence for this: just consider the flow of international capital. International capital first targets developed countries because their markets are mature, transparent, and open. It then moves to East Asian countries and is less likely to venture into Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia. Despite the large numbers of young people and potential workers, why doesn't international capital flow there? Those who control scientific and technological capital are much savvier than us intellectuals, aren't they? They go where it is profitable because in those developed countries and specific East Asian nations, the labor force is of high quality, right? 

Thus, my conclusion regarding India is that, although it has a very favorable outlook, I actually think you can see it quite clearly, but it requires the establishment of strong principles.The three principles we are discussing now are his proficiency in English, his commitment to democracy, and the presence of numerous young people. However, this is not true, correct? My analysis just now is sufficient to undermine their logic, right? Okay, I’ve addressed this topic a few times, including the intricate relationship among the five major powers. The world is progressing towards a dynamic involving two superpowers, yet middle powers demand our attention as well. Regional differentiation constitutes another concern. Additionally, there will be issues pertaining to global governance in the future. Global governance represents a general backdrop against which we can project forthcoming challenges. In the next decade, the world economy's power will remain inadequate. Despite excellent conditions in the nineties when the IT revolution was at its peak, as we entered this century, the momentum began to falter, declining further after the financial crisis. Therefore, it is a fundamental assessment of mine that, over the next ten years, there is unlikely to be a surge of momentum on par with the IT revolution of the 1990s, rendering the global economic impetus considerably weak. This is a significant judgment to make.

And what will emerge from this scenario? It will involve an emerging country, and there will be a contest between the concepts of free trade and fair trade. Countries like China and India, being highly competitive, plan to carry on the Western legacy of free trade, correct? They are proponents of free trade and general market openness, as we—I am highly competitive. Nevertheless, developed countries have started to promote the idea of fair trade. They seek equal opportunities for market access and will stress this in the future actions and policies they adopt. Thus, going forward, there will be two distinct types of countries: emerging countries and developed countries. Each will leverage their respective strategies—one favoring free trade and the other advocating fair trade. Although the surface may show a contest over rules, behind it lies a skirmish for interests. When it comes to international rules, all can benefit. Still, upon a thorough analysis, it becomes evident that different countries reap varying advantages from these rules, right?

Furthermore, it is inevitable that globalization will decelerate in the next decade. Over the past thirty years, globalization has been gathering pace, but this trend will slow down. It likely won't completely reverse—as a widespread reversal is improbable—but a slowdown is certain.

Another point to consider is the global governance deficit, which currently poses a new problem. We face numerous global challenges due to globalization. All the old issues will persist, such as the growing divide between the rich and the poor, inadequate resources, and the concerns posed by terrorism.These things are all there. What are the new problems? Like the Internet, it brings many new challenges. Oh, there are scams on the Internet, and climate change is another concern. For example, Shanghai has been experiencing temperatures of 40 degrees for more than ten days, which is very rare. Climate change has brought about extreme disasters. In short, this is the world now. Are the old global problems still unresolved? New questions have also been added. As a result, the demand for global governance is rising, but the supply of global governance is declining. Why? Because global governance has originally been provided by the United States and Europe, right? Now, these two "brothers," hehe, are both somewhat powerless. So, when demand rises and supply falls, it means that there is a global governance deficit, right? Therefore, this problem will become quite serious in the future.

This also forces China to join in on global governance. Alas, because if we don’t join in, our own interests will be harmed, right? It’s just that the issue of global governance is becoming more pressing. The fifth issue is in terms of technology and industry. My personal assessment is that, due to China’s joining, China's current investment in scientific research is increasing very rapidly. We are increasing by almost 15% every year. The United States is basically stagnant, and Trump is even planning cuts, but we are increasing. Because of our increases, the overall resource investment by humanity in scientific research has risen. So, I personally predict that in the future, new scientific and technological achievements will proliferate, and many will be made in China. Then there will be new business models. In fact, the basic principles of technology halted by the first decade of this century—and what followed was development based on the original models. Now, I find the Chinese are quite adept at utilizing other people's technology. Hey, things like bike sharing, Taobao, and cashless payments—they are doing quite well with these now, right? What are the new four great inventions? Apart from high-speed rail, in terms of industry, if I look at the others, they’re alright. It's like a new business type.

Well, some new business models will emerge. But a second industrial revolution is unlikely to appear in the next ten years. It is still in the gestation period, I estimate. And, uh, in terms of technology and industry, I have a bold idea. That is, over the next ten years, a trend may gradually emerge. In the arena of competition in technology and new industries, it will mainly be between China and the United States. This trend will become obvious.Hey, we should admit it now—even the best technology in the world is still in the United States. What we humans have conceived is the fourth industrial revolution, which extends in five directions. One is that of new materials. Now, there is a new material that may be industrialized, and that is graphene, right? It seems that Tesla has developed a battery in its laboratory that enables a car to drive a thousand kilometers with just ten minutes of charging, using graphene batteries. Thus, the new material industry, represented by graphene, is one direction.

Another is genetic engineering, a field within life sciences. Then there's AI which has developments like AlphaGo—smarter than humans. Of course, artificial intelligence will present significant challenges in the future, including issues related to international relations, sociology, and philosophy. Its development continues, and it might still pose the same dilemmas in the future. That's another question. Whether artificial intelligence may eventually surpass humans is yet another unresolved matter.

Where will we be ten years from now? Currently, people still consider artificial intelligence to be controllable. AI will remain a growth point for new industries. Additionally, the direction academician Pan Jianwei is pursuing is quantum technology, right? Quantum communications, as well as other industrial applications and new energy like nuclear fusion, are on the horizon. These areas seem to be the ones that the academic community has largely recognized as likely to yield new materials for the fourth industrial revolution; life sciences, artificial intelligence, quantum technology, and new energy.

Now, it can be said that in these five major fields, the United States possesses the best technology. Then, what deserves attention? It merits observation that China has entered the second echelon. Is it true that China now has teams in all five major fields? Without any false modesty, we are definitely on the same level as Europe and Japan. Indeed, if we were to delve into details, we might even be a little stronger than them.

So, where do India and Russia stand? They focus on participation. What about other countries? They can only hope to have a hand in deciding their future destinies, right? As I see it, they probably have no intention of participating. So, there should only be four echelons: the United States first, then we are in the second, followed by Russia and India, and lastly, the rest are in the fourth echelon.Well, in fact, the fourth industrial revolution has nothing to do with the fourth echelon, right? The only thing they have to do is to keep praying and performing good deeds to avoid punishment by fate. Uh, as for me, I estimate that in the next ten years, China is likely to stand out among the second tier, surpassing Europe and Japan. As a result, China and the United States will form a competitive dyad in future technology and industry. This is the sixth one, right? Okay, the seventh one will appear, uh. The new field of international competition, related to the technology industry, is the arena of future human competition. In addition to the traditional domains of land, sea, and air, we will also enter new spaces, namely, the internet, outer space, and the deep sea. It's within these realms that humanity will increase its development, leading to heightened competition, right?

Therefore, the areas that humans have explored have expanded, and consequently, so have the arenas for competition. Beyond the traditional domains of land, sea, and air, there will undoubtedly be new battlegrounds within these four vectors: cyberspace, polar regions, the deep sea, and outer space, right? This is the seventh one, right?

The eighth issue is political stability over the next ten years. How to say? Political stability is challenging for all countries, uh, but compared to the past decade, it is tough for both the East and the West. In the past ten years, everyone might recall that it was more challenging for non-Western countries. For example, there were color revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe, and then there was the Arab Spring in the Arab world. Well, the West remained stable, but mainly because the non-West was less stable. I think that the next ten years will be very difficult for both the West and non-Western countries.

In the West, there is a current issue that the mainstream is dividing. The mainstream, called Main Street, right? The mainstream is dividing, and the populist elite is also splitting. This elite used to dominate various resources, but now, as we can see from the phenomena of Trump and Brexit, populism has risen in the West. And then, the contradiction between the populists and the elites has emerged within their societies, alongside more extreme conflicts between the left and the right, right? Last year in the United States, Trump, the real estate developer, was elected president, but please note that there is another person worthy of attention, that is Sanders of the Democratic Party on the left.Right. The other person he pulled away from first was an industrial group. Conflicts with virtual economic groups will rise. This guy, like Trump, actually represents an industrial group, right? He is somewhat skeptical about the virtual economy. In the past ten years, the virtual economy has dominated the United States.

So, at least these three contradictions can be seen from the British, American, and European elections last year. There are three major contradictions: between populism and elites, left and right, industry and virtual economy. The conclusion is that the mainstream in the West is dividing. The mainstream is dividing, which will lead to political instability in the West because a prerequisite for multi-party democracy is that it is very strong without instruments. The mainstream is very strong and then splits into different factions. At this time, multi-party democracy can be fought without breaking. But if the mainstream loses, multi-party democracy will suffer, then there will be a real war, and then there could be a civil war. You know, there will be a real war. So now, Western multi-party democracy has encountered problems with its social premise, which is the mainstream division.

Okay, what about the non-Western? In the past ten years, many places have been unstable, and they will still be unstable in the next ten years because other developing countries have so many airplanes. What are their problems? Once they urbanize, as many countries are urbanizing, urbanization itself will bring political impact, right? It turns out they were all in rural areas, where people are quite scattered. Not only is it easy to organize, but it can also lead to criminal offenses. However, it is difficult to launch a political movement, but once you get to the city, after urbanization, your political consciousness will rise, your demands will increase, and your organizational capabilities will also be strengthened. Urbanization is a necessary step for modernization. But from a political perspective, it will cause problems. 

Then there's universal education. Well, after education is popularized, people's political demands will increase. There is also the emergence of a middle class. Now, all emerging countries and other less developed countries are facing this problem. Urbanizing the middle class and expanding the popularization of education are all things that modernization must do, but they all come with political pressure.

In addition, there is an impact on both the West and non-Western countries, and that is the impact of the Internet, right? The Internet will bring about two worlds: a real world and a virtual world, right? In the virtual world, there are very fun things, but there are also many very extreme things. Well, many people go online in a very gentle way in their daily lives, and it seems like they become a different person, right? It has become extremely neurotic.Well, OK, this is about the political stability of various countries, and the cost of maintaining it is higher than before. Before, it was mostly non-Western, right? We encountered the Arab Spring, a color revolution, but we will also have this problem within the West in the future. Then there's the clash of civilizations—this, what about Clash of Civilizations? I call it the War of the Gods. This is based on interests but goes beyond general interests. For example, if we are from the same civilization, our conflicts are mainly conflicts of real interests, right? So, if we are worshiping different gods, in addition to actual conflicts of interest, what about conflicts between gods? You know, the spiritual father in my mind—this is the spiritual father that Professor Wen talked about—and I beat him to protect the spiritual father, so the person is a little crazy, right? It was originally a conflict of interest for me, and everyone's interests can be calculated, right? Forget it, then make arrangements to solve it.

The War of the Gods needs to be introduced, which is quite troublesome. The one that's quite difficult to solve? Well, the clash of civilizations is the War of the Gods, right? This is based on interests but goes beyond interests. Then, in the next ten years, the conflict of internal civilizations and the conflict of external civilizations will interweave. Well, the conflicts of internal civilizations will mainly be concentrated in Europe, right? There are more and more refugees in Europe, and among them, Islam accounts for a large proportion. Then, it will cause a backlash from mainstream European society, right? Then the conflict of civilizations within Europe will become serious, and it will also happen in the United States, but it will be controllable. Um, but in Europe, this problem will be very serious.

Then there is the conflict of external civilizations. The conflicts of external civilizations mainly occur in two places: one is the Western world and Islam, and the other is India and Islam. I think this will be very prominent. Okay, the last trend is that non-traditional security issues will become more severe in the next ten years, based on the past. Well, there are so many here.

Currents of thought, first of all, are very extreme. In this future, I personally estimate that there will be a struggle between two universal values. A universal value in the 21st century is American, right? It is this universal value of mine that represents the advanced direction. There is another one, the seventh-century universal value, right? Muhammad, who said that you are all a bunch of fools, it was done by elements, that does not count.The saint made a statement that represents a universal value. So, later on, when that person online discusses universal values, if you ask him what he means by returning late, he'll clarify which one he's referring to. You're aware that it's because there are 16 billion people involved, right? The appeal is quite powerful, isn't it? That is characteristic of our Chinese ethos. This company has a weakness; it views humanity from a Western perspective. Isn't it somewhat inappropriate for non-Western people? Essentially, it's racist, and there's a desire for it to become more overtly racist. Look at what's being discussed; it's about China and the world, with the world being equated to the West. The conflict between China and the West represents more than half of the human population. The West counts for only 15, and we're 20; together, we're 35 out of the global population, and the other two-thirds are deemed non-human by these perspectives. Excluding them from the entire analytic framework is cruel, don't you think? When you confront him in an argument, you must ask him which universal value he is referring to. You cannot claim that there were 116 billion tourists at that time; they are no longer considered human. This line of thinking is a trend that I believe will become increasingly divisive in the future.

Especially noteworthy are those two markets that stand as the universal values of the 7th and 21st centuries. And to be honest, it's impossible to convince anyone outright. I'm older now, and although I used to believe that debate could solve problems, I've come to realize that it doesn't. A person becomes obstinate in their values once they are formed, and they are unlikely to change. They won't change at all. When you get sick, you end up feeling hurt and angry later on because you can't persuade the other person. You know how people change? It's through their values. Let him act according to his beliefs. If he fails, his values will be affected by you. Reasoning alone is futile; only practice can educate him.

This is my inference: ideological trends will become more polarized than they have been in the past decade. Then, the issues of immigration and refugees will become more acute. This is an unchangeable trend, and the situation for immigrants and refugees will deteriorate. In addition, the three forces of terrorism, extremism, and separatism will persist, and they may grow even stronger.Well, I don't quite understand the truth, but it seems to me that not only do the three forces exist, but they will also become more powerful. Right? Competition among ideological trends is becoming more intense; the challenges posed by immigrants and refugees are growing more serious, and the three types of strength are increasing in power. Food security is an age-old problem, yet there is hope that we can improve our handling of it. We, China, are beginning to get involved in global governance, correct? Since October 2015, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee has shown a significant interest in this issue. I personally think it was a remarkable moment when we had a collective study and invited Qin Yaqing, the dean of the Foreign Affairs University, to speak on globalization. This demonstrates a serious sign that we are keen on participating in global governance. As a country with exceptionally strong action capabilities, once we get involved, I personally estimate that we will outperform the West in resolving some issues, including those related to food security.

What about food? Correct, we have no issue with production thanks to our current food growing technology. With the existing cultivated land, humans can actually feed up to 15 billion people. The latest statistics indicate that the global population is around 7.6 billion; hence, theoretically, there should be no hunger. Yet, as of now, there still is. About 860 million people, from a biological perspective, are experiencing hunger in regions such as Africa and Latin America. Take Haiti, for example, which is very close to the United States. We Chinese have now somewhat forgotten what it's like not to have enough to eat, right? Since the reform and open-up policy, we have addressed food scarcity through industrialization and industrial technology. Presently, we are well-fed and have no problems with quantity. Our main concern now is food safety, as it poses potential risks. Being full is fine, but in a place like Shanghai, eating is not an issue, right? The problem is that after enjoying something delicious, girls often worry about their figures, then feel guilty after indulging, and consequently, they work out excessively. It's a rarity that we allow ourselves to have a truly good meal the next time. We've resolved this issue, correct? We just want to eat well and healthily. But let me tell you, globally there are still 860 million people who do not have enough to eat in a biological sense.This is a pretty good one. I think this is a case of global governance failure. However, I hope and also believe that with China's intervention in global governance, this problem will be solved. Hey, British people, when it comes to the problem of feeding humans, our city is the biggest one in China, right? Okay, so this problem is a good one, in that the trend of thought will become more intensified, resulting in more serious issues with immigration, and the three groups of forces will become more serious. Yet, I tend to think that food security will get better because the issue is actually about distribution, isn't it, rather than a production problem. Is the production enough? If the production is sufficient but the distribution is poor, then after China intervenes and improves the distribution efficiency, I think the problem will be alleviated.

What about the resource problem, then? Well, I can’t make a definitive conclusion about the two trends now; I can only say that the two trends coexist simultaneously. For one, the industrialization of China, India, and Africa will lead to increased demand for resources, right? Naturally, this can make the situation more tense. But what about the other side? Because of technological progress, especially China's, it is possible that the resource problem can be alleviated. It's a competition between two forces, right?

Well, I can only say that I look forward to it. I hope that our renewable energy will grow at a faster rate than the industrial population's demand for resources. That would make it easier. Hey, this is a positive cycle. China should play a more significant role in solving resource problems in this process. 

That last point is about the next ten years. It's vital for us humans to solve the problem of climate control and climate change. If we work together, this is to achieve low-carbon growth, right? The economy is growing, but carbon emissions must be controlled. If we can manage this, especially starting from China, then we have great hopes of controlling climate change in the future. 

Well, but if that is not managed well, then this problem may become very serious in the future. Okay, this is my prediction on ten aspects of this future world. It’s a very rough and very personal prediction. But anyway, after I put it forward, there will be targets for discussion one by one. You can refine and correct based on this. I will stop sharing my opinions with you here. It’s a bit overdue. Thank you, everyone.Thank you.
