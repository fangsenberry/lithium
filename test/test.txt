Overview

Scholars' and analysts' ability to predict is very poor. This month's main task is to use hindsight to summarize the mistakes and successful experiences made in the past so that we can move forward more steadily in the future. The prediction function is poor and cannot be compared with natural science. Of course, I know about natural sciences such as climatology and meteorology, which are at a similar level to ours. It turns out that the father-in-law of a friend of mine is the chief engineer of the China Meteorological Administration. I once asked him, uh, he said that the level of meteorological prediction is about the same as that of the old farmer who watches the sky, and he is at the same level of accuracy as us. But since I chose this topic, I will make a bold prediction because there must be one. Let me start, and then everyone can criticize. Then, through mutual criticism, can we find some reliable path?

Looking 10 years into the future

What about me? Well, for the sake of simplicity, I'll just say, what's the trend I think of in the next ten years? Uh, divided into ten aspects, the first thing that comes to my mind is that the next ten years will determine international relations. Or a big country? I think this is the first element. Relations between major countries still come first. Although we scholars like to talk about some marginal scholars, we will regard non-traditional security and other things very highly, judging from historical experience. Relations between major powers are still the most important to international relations.

Well, I predict that the relations between major countries in the next ten years will be more complicated than in the past ten years. This is a big judgment and more complicated. Well, first, let me define it. it is difficult for big countries to define it. I am just saying that from an empirical point of view, uh, the big country I am talking about here refers to these six countries and country groups, and this is China. The United States, Russia, and the European Union, whose operational capabilities are equivalent to that of a big country, then Japan, then India.

Brazil is not considered a big country. Brazil is big enough to become a big country. But it is a pity that its upward mobility is relatively poor. this. I have been to Brazil twice, and my Brazilian friends said that God must be Brazilian. Humph, because I love Brazil so much. Then you talk to Brazilians about being hungry and cold, and they don’t understand that. They rarely feel hungry and can eat whatever they want. That product is so rich. As for the weather, they don’t feel cold. You know, a Brazilian friend of mine first came to China. He arrived in Beijing in January. We said that he should wear more clothes, and she agreed to wear more clothes. He brought three pairs of long-sleeved shirts and, as soon as he left the Beijing airport, he was freezing, and I had to quickly buy him this down jacket because he usually wears shorts and shorts. He said “I brought three pairs of long sleeves, so that’s not bringing extra clothes, right?” So the conditions in their place are so good, so good. Still, there are some problems, they are unorganized, and their organizational skills are very poor, and human progress depends on organizational skills.

The more powerful the moderator is measured. It's like the degree of development is higher. The literary teacher who went to Taiwan to give a lecture had a more grounded point of view, right? Uh, Guangtu Giant Clan, right? Oops, I think this point of view is very good. This belongs to the language concept of Chinese social sciences. It can develop theoretical loess. The loess crew is actually a very difficult one later. The process of improving organizational skills is quite good. Well, Brazil lacks this thing. So in fact, God really likes his 8.5 million square kilometers of land, and there is nothing that costs anything. I traveled across Brazil twice on the plane, and I was extremely envious. There was no secret about Huang Tutu. It was not like Beijing, where we were heading to Europe. For half an hour, the whole area below is yellow and bald. Can you see the green color within half an hour? The whole thing behind is that yellow bald Brazil. It’s not you. You can’t see the yellow. You can’t see it here. It’s actually the biggest. The lungs of the Amazon forest are in his place. The actual kidneys are the Amazon River. To what extent is the Amazon and water distributed there? During its dry season, its water volume is eight times that of our Yangtze River. It's the dry season, it's the wet season, you, if you close it and open it, it's the sea. Just because you can't see the two sides, you know, so he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he is a big country, but it's a pity that he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he, he just lacks organization. Ability, so he can't enter a big country. Therefore , the big countries here are these six, China, the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and India. So what do I personally think from the objective conditions? Well, the objective competition conditions between China and the United States should be better than those between Russia, Europe and Japan in the next ten years. Hey Russia. The population is small, right? There are 142 million people. It seems that the population is still shrinking now. It is not shrinking as fast as Japan. It is still shrinking. This looks like a Russian girl today who only gives birth to 0.67 children in her lifetime. Haha, that's so selfish. Our girl is okay, but now she is born. On average it seems to be 1.2. Well, so we are okay, they are 0.7. Europe is also aging now, and there are also problems with unity within Europe. Japan is also a problem. Japan has an absolute population decrease, right? Last year there was a decrease of 360,000 people. Well. So from the perspective of population situation and resource situation, as well as the national organization and mobilization capabilities, uh, among these six, China, Russia and India. He also wants to be better. This is an objective judgment, but what about subjectively? What about the Six Nations and the Group of Six in the future? In fact, they behave in similar ways. They all have to take care of internal affairs first. If there is no internal instability, everything will be over, so doing internal affairs well is the first priority. Then, secondly, try to improve relations with other continents. Hey, I hope that the relationship between other major countries will be closer to me than the relationship between them. This is what I think. And are these two things done well? It's international relations. That is to say, after the internal affairs are handled well and the international relations are handled well, then we can advance our own international agenda. So everyone should actually behave in the same way. The subjective behavior methods are all three points: internal, then external relations, and then advancing their own agenda. So generally speaking, in the future, the relationship between major powers will be very complicated, and the mutual suspicion between them, uh, should be deepened. So what about China? Well, China-Russia relations and China-EU relations should generally be stable in the future. What is more difficult for us to deal with are the three types of relations between China, the United States, China, Japan, China and India. The relationship above should be very difficult to deal with. From the perspective of the United States, uh, as China's power converges with its own in the future, it will become more and more nervous. And what about our reaction? It will become less and less calm. Uh, I, I am studying the United States. I have been studying the United States since 1984. Now I am 33 years old. My personal experience is that the United States is changing. Uh, it has entered menopause. It used to be quite good-tempered. It turns out that he is very confident. It turns out that the United States is quite cute and he is very confident. But of course there is something wrong with his confidence, he just likes to boss around. He likes to boss people around, but overall he is easy to deal with, because after becoming more confident, he is tolerant and humorous, and it doesn't matter if he scolds him, he is like him, but he also makes fun of himself. Now the United States is becoming like India, very sensitive, right? I like to listen to flattery and I am happy that you speak well. You scold him and he gets angry with you. The sense of humor is gone and it is not as easy to deal with as before. So I guess this will be the case in the future. It is China, which is converging in power with the United States. Then the United States has a bad temper, and then the relationship is quite difficult. Japan, what about Japan? I personally think that among all the countries in the world, it is the most difficult to accept the rise of China. Uh, because Japan has two psychology that other countries don’t have. Uh, one is that it is stupidly racist towards China. One has a very deep sense of guilt. These two psychology are not found in other countries. Hey, his racism must have been in the past hundred years or so. What about Japan? Learn from the West. Leave Asia and join Europe? Then I learned one thing from the West and one of the great things is the industrial system. It was he who mastered modern manufacturing and then industrialized. As for industrialization, it has done very well. How good is it? Not only does our Asian country rank first, but also 180 non-Western countries and regions around the world rank first. And what about us in China? What about a while? The foolish rejection of industrialization was mainly due to the late Qing Dynasty in the 1970s. Year foolishly refused. So the government and the opposition here worked hard to learn and learned very well, but here, they foolishly refused, and the consequences were formed. Industrial Japan versus agricultural China. In 1937, Japan fully invaded China. From an international political perspective, it was Japan's invasion of China. From a historical perspective, it is actually industry attacking agriculture. His meeting is like this and you are like that. So what result will such a historical background lead to? It is Japan that has formed a very obvious comprehensive industrial and technological advantage over China, right? this. This is a very long time of more than a hundred years. This is a fact that must be respected and acknowledged, and then learn to correct it humbly. But the problem occurs in the next step, that is, Japanese theorists, politicians and strategists, who mistakenly interpreted its technological advantage for a period of time as the eternal advantage of Japanese civilization over Chinese civilization. This is a sneaky change of concept, you know? Well, what about some people? It's quite bad and narrow-minded. He interpreted it to mean that the Japanese were better than the Chinese, which created racism. And it's very deep-rooted. Well, in the process of making this, Dangdang also made many, many cultural lies, and then a bunch of stupid intellectuals in China have been repeating this cultural lie for a hundred years. Give him two cultural lies and one of them, the Japanese It turns out that Chinese people are careless and careless. I agree, because Chinese people are generally careless. Later I went to the United States, and I discovered that Americans behaved exactly like us. Later, when I went to Russia, I discovered that it was called so-so. Then I went to Brazil and India, and I realized that they were the only ones who had so-so. There is no bottom line. Well, China is considered a good country among big countries, you know, but the Japanese say that it is a problem unique to China. Hey, this is not right, right? Well, the Chinese are a bunch of stupid literati. Let me just say, hey, they are so stupid. This Japanese is bad. What is the stupidity of the Chinese counterpart? Got it. Of course, some people understand, and he says it deliberately, but he is just stupid and bad, right? There is also a cultural lie that Chinese people are not united. What a mess. This has a great impact on China’s intellectual and political circles. Even Mr. Sun told him, Mr. Zhongshan, right? The one who was the father of the Republic of China. The harm is also agreed. I felt that this judgment was correct. Later, I traveled around the world because I have been to the United States more than 100 times and to almost 70 other countries and regions. About seventy. I later discovered that my final conclusion was that compared to normal humans, we are actually more united than most of them. Well, for example, Africa, Africa, you are like the massacre in Rwanda, right? Tutsi and Hutu. Oops, they have massacred 1.3 million people in four months. They are another race. That tribal conflict is so cruel. It turns out that during the colonial era, colonists went to Africa to catch slaves, right? The main thing is that the various tribes capture each other and sell them to Europeans, and it is not mainly the Europeans who capture them. You can know the cruelty inside, right? Then you look at the Middle East, North Africa and West Asia, and the contradictions are too profound, right? Then there are ethnic conflicts, Persians, Arabs, Kurds and others. That's so cruel. And within their sect, Shia Sunni, right? A contradiction too profound. I heard that there is an Arabic proverb that says that if you encounter Persians and poisonous snakes in the desert, you must kill the Persians first, right? This, and then South Asia, right? South Asia, Pakistan, and India, they actually used to be a civilized race. In fact, they are all mixed black and white, and they are all the same, uh, but now you see that the momentum is like fire and water, eh, that . Well. Then you may say that Africa, the Middle East, and South Asia should not be compared with each other, but rather Europe. What about Europe? We can do this better than the Slavs, right? Hey, you see, everyone knows that Slavic people are divided into three parts, right? The representative of West Slavia, East Slavia, and Yugoslavia is Poland. The representative of East Slavia is Russia, right? Do they hate each other? Especially the hatred of Poland towards Russia, uh, everyone should have read the book about Brzezinski is Brezinski. The big chess game is covered in this. Because he himself is Polish, he knows the feelings of this nation. He said that the Poles' hatred of the Russians was born in their mother's womb. Those who don’t need education will already hate them before they even speak. Okay, if we go a little smaller, it's East Slavs East Slavs are three brothers, right? Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, now you look at Ukraine, how deep the hatred of Russia is. right? But from a scientific perspective, do you need to compare yourself with a psychopath? It's not necessary, right? That's not scientific. Hey, yes, OK, this is off topic, because the other Japanese are actually. He has been fighting against China for the past 100 years. He is a Japanese with a bit of a mental disorder, but he actually knows in his heart that China is his cultural adoptive mother. If you are interested in traveling to Japan, don’t just buy things. Don’t just spend 12,000 yuan to buy a toilet seat. That’s too stupid, right? You Shanghainese spend 20,000 yuan to travel, travel money to Japan, and then spend 12,000 yuan to buy a toilet seat, right? Then I discovered that it was produced in the suburbs of Hangzhou. Are you just stupid? That's it, is this a standard modern idiotic freshness? this. Well. Then what? that. Uh, if you go in the future, go to Ueno Park to see the Japan, uh, National Museum of History. Hey, you will find out. Japan entered the dynasty from the Kofun Period in 702. Very late. He, he only entered a very young nation from a tribe into a dynasty in the eighth century, right? And then, that, uh, what he accepted was the Doctor of the Five Classics? Doctors of the Five Classics came from the Korean Peninsula, so its culture started from studying Confucianism, and then added Han Buddhism to Han Buddhism, uh, it is also called Mahayana Buddhism. This is Japan. Even Japan has evolved from barbarians and tribes to civilization. It learned from us. We are the foster mother of its culture. So after modernization, they will attack us when they come up. He knows it in his heart, so in order to convince himself and to shock the Chinese, he wants to humiliate you. You know, he wants to make you extremely miserable so that he can get rid of you, and he can. He was looking for comfort for himself, so why did he go to Nanjing? Then everyone has already surrendered after the massacre. There is this kind of collective mentality behind such a humiliating massacre. OK, so, uh, this is going a bit far. Organization is a big conclusion. As for Japan, it did do well in industrialization for a period of time, but after doing well, it began to make mistakes. This mistake is the two leaps of reasoning I just talked about. You know, describing a period of technological advantages as the eternal advantages of civilization, and then turning them into human advantages. Hey, this. This is definitely wrong in theory, right? But they have a very deep-rooted attitude toward China, which is called racial superiority. This sense of superiority prevents them from accepting the rise of China. In fact, today they have begun to face difficulties because of China's technological advantages? As for its existence, it has a premise. Well, according to my understanding, this technical advantage is part of the broad knowledge advantage. This can include technology and institutions, right? Including narrow sense of knowledge. It is part of the broad knowledge advantage, and everyone must be clear about the knowledge advantage. It is completely reparable through the learning process. Japan's technological superiority is predicated on the Chinese's foolish refusal to learn. As long as the Chinese start to learn, it will be a matter of time before they catch up with them technically. It will be a matter of one day sooner or one day later. You know, as China now starts to industrialize seriously, we are catching up step by step. Hey, now a few things have caught up, and now they are embedded in the confusion of the whole people. Now if you talk to the Japanese, they can't understand them. First, they originally thought that you are the greatest electronic empire, uh, you should press beautiful, right, invincible. When I get up now, Sony will say that you can't be found, is that right? You are still here, and you have become our Huawei. A wage earner. So Huawei’s accessories supplier. Another one is a Japanese scholar. My high-speed rail is called the Shinkansen in Japan, right? Does he think I am the only one in the world? No one can beat my high-speed rail. Now he clearly knows that our high-speed rail is better than him. There are three major high-speed rail systems in the world, France, Japan, and China. We are the best, you know? The Shinkansen has a top speed of 246 per hour, and the French Eurostar has a top speed of 272. Well, our place is less than 300 kilometers away, so I’m embarrassed to call it a high-speed rail, right? We call it EMU. According to Chinese standards, Japan is a country without high-speed rail, right? Why do you 246 have the nerve to call it a high-speed rail? It's not scientific. Now the whole Japanese people are confused. They think that I, you and others are confused when they see China now, he said. This is wrong, what's wrong? It seems like he said you shouldn't be able to do it, why can you do it? This is unscientific. He is very confused. In fact, he does not know the truth behind it. His technological advantage is very fragile. You know, the premise for the existence of his technological advantage is that the Chinese make mistakes. Once we correct the error, the technical advantage is quickly gone and that's what's happening now. Hey, this is Japan, it is here now, it is particularly painful, that is, it is more painful than other countries, and that is why it has set a trick for itself. Hey, there is also a special Japanese psychology, that is, it has a very deep understanding of us. With a sense of guilt, he definitely knows that modern history has done us wrong. Right? They attacked us during the Sino-Japanese War, oh, and then fully invaded China, right? This is a particularly cruel one. Of course he is afraid that we will get stronger and take revenge on him. It's a bit like that drug trafficker. Drug traffickers know that what they catch is a capital crime, right? So the criminals are going to be beaten when the police come, right? As usual, we let a small-scale police officer come in. I think this is very honest. He just nodded and bowed, right? Drug traffickers must give you a beating, right? Because it's a capital crime, right? Alas, Japan itself feels that he has actually committed a particularly serious crime of capital punishment. Hey, in fact, he must have said it now that he is thinking about it. China is a particularly good country among big countries, right? As long as the Japanese admit their mistake, it will be over, but now they do not admit their mistake, so Sino-Japanese relations will definitely be very troublesome in the next ten years. It is these two collective psychology that they themselves are not very clear about. Yes, I am aware of this mentality, but it exists and is widespread. It is difficult to eliminate it. As for India, it will definitely be very troublesome in the future. We have real problems with border conflicts, right? And then, objectively speaking, we all rose up at the same time, right? There is a situation of strategic competition, so in short, this is my feeling. In the future relations between major powers, there will be no problem between China and Europe, and there will be no problem between China and Russia. But these three pairs of the United States, Japan and India must be troublesome. OK, this is a bit of a story. I didn’t control my time well. I should go faster. The second major trend is that, uh, the world is moving towards two superpowers. Like the multipolarization we recommended before, it is two superpowers with multiple powers. It is not designed. It is my logic. It is under the condition that China maintains domestic political stability. Our economic development is faster than that of most big countries. Well. Well, because on the basis of rapid economic development, our comprehensive national strength will steadily increase, right? So, in the next ten years, I estimate that we will be... We should keep distance from other big countries, right? Like Japan, Germany, and Russia, the gap between them and us must be narrowing or widening. Uh, as for the Chinese economy, there is a secret to development, that is, we have two wheels and two engines. Uh, one of us is the market. There are a group of Chinese people who are born with market skills. Especially our area is the Yangtze River Delta in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. You know, there are some Chinese people whose ancestral home is in Zhejiang, right? We are four cousins, and everyone is richer than me. He sees me as quite pitiful. Vitamins, I have something, everyone has sympathy and understanding, they are actually born entrepreneurs, they feel very good, uh, then there are also a group of such people in the Pearl River Delta, and then there are also a group of such people in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Yes, of course there are other places as well. There are many talented entrepreneurs in China. This nation is capable of playing the market economy and it can be played. What else? Chinese local governments consider it the second engine, right? Secondly, every party secretary of the local government is actually a CEO, thinking about how to attract investment all day long, so the Chinese economy actually has two wheels. that. In the past two years, there is one wheel that has caught fire a little bit, that is, the local government wheel. But I estimate that this wheel will restart after the 19th National Congress, and we will return to two-wheel drive. So our economy will be faster. So if you have been able to survive in your business over the past few years. There should be more opportunities after the 19th National Congress, but the United States is a one-wheel drive. The United States is the market . The market in the United States is very good. This must be acknowledged. Well, in fact, the future will be more troublesome and larger. Russia. As for Russia, he doesn’t know how to play market economy. He doesn’t know how to do it, so he doesn’t know how to play. He was born to play a planned economy, but he didn’t have the conditions for a planned economy. Does this planned economy need a strong Central Committee, a strong Discipline Inspection Commission, and strong state-owned enterprises? They are gone now, they no longer exist. So now he mainly relies on selling resources. right? Russia relied on oil exports for 50% of its fiscal year last year and 80% on oil exports. The entire country has fallen into a resource trap. And that one is very fragile, uh, so in this sense, Americans do not think highly of Russia economically. Some American media call Russia the Saudi Arabia with nuclear weapons. Er, OK, this is a basic judgment, it is China. Well, of course there is a major premise, which is domestic political stability. If it is gone, then this premise is gone, right? I. I have a premise that domestic policies must be stable, but under the premise that the economy is good, and the economy is good, China's national strength will develop well in the future. In this way, China will distance itself from other big countries, big countries other than the United States, and then distance itself from the United States. It's close. Because of this, because China and the United States are getting closer, the final pattern of the world will be. From one super strong to two super strong, this is a judgment, and then we will talk about it. To be more specific, it is the main platform for world governance, which will be the G20 in the future. Qiqi will still exist, but the effectiveness of the machine will still decline, right? It is a platform subject to global governance. In the near future, the G20 or the G20 will replace the G7. Well, it may not necessarily replace it. It may not replace it. This is the role of Qi Qi Jianlin, which will be dominant. This is one, and there is China. If it is promoted, China's comprehensive national strength will become stronger. Therefore, some new international mechanisms promoted by China will be even more important. For example, the AIIB, the NRIC Bank, the CICA Conference, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, uh, China is actually still promoting the next bank, which is the SCO Bank, and we are still promoting it. This, uh, there is another rumor that China will take the Group of 77, which has a South-South Cooperation Bank to exist. I think it has been almost 60 years and has died. They urgently need an effective one. The leader should know. Well, then China may be thinking about transforming this one. OK, these are some mechanisms promoted by China. There are also some initiatives, such as the One Belt and One Road, and some concepts, such as a community with a shared future for mankind and a global partnership network. Mechanisms like China's will be more active, and these creative concepts will have a greater impact. OK, this is the second biggest trend, right? Moving towards two superpowers, and then there are some contents below. As for the third one, in the next ten years, there will be some internet celebrities from medium-power countries. We need, uh, to pay more attention to them and love them because of the role they play. will be bigger. Well, in my mind, the four major powers that we should pay special attention to in the next ten years are Vietnam. Indonesia. Iran, Türkiye. in this world. Vietnam's industrialization should be done well. I've been to Vietnam twice. This one was called Saigon before I went to Ho Chi Minh City. Oops, it's like noon at three o'clock in the evening. It's so lively. That woman is so hard-working. She's really a man. , I thought he was a bit lazy, drinking tea there and snoring next to him, that woman was very hard-working. Well, it is this country that has the ability to industrialize. What about population? More than 90 million will soon exceed 100 million, right? Where is the population base, and where is the industrial capacity? It seems that the International Mathematical Olympiad results came out the day before yesterday or last week, right? South Korea is first, China is second, and Vietnam is third. Is it that one? Well, it must be, I think it's a pretty powerful one, and then. The diplomatic strategy is also very good. It is not easy for him, and it is very difficult, so this is particularly important. And Indonesia, uh, in Indonesia, the population belongs first to the population itself, right? Well, location will also be important. With the rise of China, right, the rise of India. Being in the vicinity of these two future rising powers, it will have spillover effects, and it can benefit from the fact that the strategic focus of the United States is here again. Right, from now on, the three very influential countries will be here. It can take advantage of its large population and good resources. The necessary conditions are also good, and everyone will try to get one. Therefore, its external environment is also mixed, and it is estimated that it is still very promising. Just now, Indonesia’s internal problems are bigger than others. Master, the leader of the Communist Party of Vietnam, is he a land reformer? After the map is changed, it will be very beneficial to the country's industrialization. Land reform is an important part of a country's modernization. In many Southeast Asian countries, African countries, and Latin American countries, the first obstacle to modernization in South Asian countries is here, which is why there is no land reform, and then there is uneven wealth, you know. Well, there are very rich people in this country, and 90% of the real estate in that country belongs to their family. He is very rich, but as for his money, he has taken it from the international market and handed it over to the hedge fund in the United States. To make that excess profit, they don’t invest in their country. You know, this country has money, but this money is not controlled by the country. Then they only invest it outside, and then their family becomes richer. But the entire country is poor and has no funds for modernization. You know, and then it was not easy to introduce foreign investment, uh, and develop a little industry, uh, because everyone is poor, he is fine. He is trapped in a vicious cycle. After he corrected it, it was different. After the land reform, wealth was distributed more evenly, and the society itself was rich. Still, industrialization is conditional. You know, Indonesia has bigger internal problems than Vietnam, uh, but in an abstract sense, in a general sense, its resource conditions are quite good, and its population, resources, and external environment are quite good. , so we should not underestimate it. There is also Iran. Oh, Iran, Iran should belong to this, first of all, it has a long civilization. Ah, some people think that his five thousand years of history are real, and then say that many of your five thousand years of Chinese history are myths. You are really close to more than four thousand or three thousand years, right? He said that I am actually five thousand years old, and my cultural heritage is very good. This nation has a large population, right? It should be quite a lot, more than 1.6 million in the land is not a small amount. Then, it should be said that it is rare in the Muslim world. A country with its own industry has a certain industrial base. And now, as for Iran, the overall situation is not bad, as of now. Frankly speaking, with the rise of Iran, I think the first project is the United States, not himself. The first, uh, second is himself. First job, why is the United States? In fact, there was a period of time when Iran was having a hard time, after the Green Revolution in Iran in 1979, and after the subsequent revolutions, he was very pitiful, because the entire West hated him, right? He didn't hold the United States hostage, he held the entire West hostage, he then took the entire Sunni world hostage. Then, with the support of the West and Saudi Arabia, Saddam went to fight him. The Iran-Iraq war has been going on for eight and a half years, and more than 4.6 million people have died in Iran. Very miserable. That, so we were beaten militarily, isolated politically, and then economically very difficult because of 79. years later. It was after the second oil crisis. The first oil crisis was in 1973, and then after the two oil crises in 1979, Westerners began to industrialize, and then the price of oil began to decrease. Iran relies heavily on oil. So it was very difficult financially for a long time. Being beaten in terms of security and being isolated politically is pitiful and pitiful. Well. However, in this century, with the help of the Americans, it is now, uh, turning over and coming back to life. The first thing the United States did was to kill its old enemy Saddam. So when it comes to democracy in Iraq, democracy is about heads, it is decided by the number of people, uh, is it decided by the number of people? The Shiites backed by Iran won. Uh, because 60% of Iraq's population is Shia? Twenty Sunnis and twenty Kurds, so the oil is now in Iran. Now we actually control the situation in Iraq. This, after Iraq takes control, it can connect with the Syrian government, which is Shiite. Is Syria connected? Just connected to that Hezbollah, right? Hezbollah is Shia, so now what? It turns out that Iran is very pitiful. It was hiding in the Persian Gulf, and now it has gone to the Mediterranean . There is no one from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean, so its security is not under so much pressure now. And then diplomatically, uh, the situation changed again. Also, because of the increase in oil prices in recent years, the economy has also recovered. Hey, so Iran is in a much better position now than it was ten years ago, and its future is also promising. so what? So why is Israel particularly afraid of him? Because it is probably the only country in the Muslim world that will pose a real threat to Israel in the future. The others are really not good. You don’t have the ability. You know, he is capable of that, so Israel is particularly afraid of that. Then the United States was influenced by Israel, and now it wants to deal with it. But I estimate that Iran will still become an independent Middle Eastern force and play a role there, so this country should be optimistic about it. Finally, Türkiye is the most important among the middle powers. We need to pay attention to him. Turkey's Erdogan is very ambitious. He wants to promote what is called neo-Ottomanism, led by Dr. Altman, neo-Ottomanism, and then Well, he will be the country that brings a lot of changes to the Middle East. OK , this is the third trend, which is to pay attention to these four middle powers, because they will play a greater role. What about Brazil? In fact, I just said that consideration is for a big country, but its role is that of a middle power. Other middle powers worthy of attention include South Korea and Myanmar. Uh, then, uh, Kazakhstan, and then every week, Mexico and Argentina should be, uh, more important, and then Egypt, Israel, uh uh, uh, they all have to pay attention to this, but the most important ones are the ones I listed earlier. Four Vietnam, Indonesia, Iran and Turkey, this is the third major trend in the future. As for the fourth major trend, this region will become more divided. Well, in the next ten years, I estimate that North America and Australia will be very stable from the perspective of international relations. These two are the real islands of stability in the world. Then, Europe and Middle East Asia are where we are. Well, it should be considered a stable island. There are many conflicts in both places, but because our management capabilities are relatively strong, we can probably be stable. The future is the Middle East, which will definitely be more chaotic than the past ten years. The Shia and Sunni factions will fight even more fiercely. Also, there is a new variable first, the Kurds, right? Then coupled with the Turkey and Iran I mentioned earlier, they will be more active, so the Middle East will be more chaotic. I think Africa may be better. Africa will be better off than it has been in the past decade. Of course, Africa does not yet have the ability to develop itself economically and control itself in terms of security. He needs the international community to help him, eh, but help will be more effective, but it turns out that it is useless. Now it is like helping and it will have some effect. Therefore, Africa will be worse than the Middle East, which is somewhat opposite to the Middle East, while Africa will be relatively better. And frankly speaking, Africa is relatively good. China's contribution must be the first, which means that China has really brought glory to Africa. right? Now when people go to Ethiopia, they say that China is full of construction sites, with cranes, and there are two signs, right? The one on the top is in Chinese, and the bottom is in local characters. That, and then the situation is good. Job opportunities are increasing. Uh, OK, this is the situation in the region. Uh, America and Australia are the most stable, Asia and East Asia are the second most stable, then the Middle East is more chaotic, Africa is better, and then Central Asia has internal power transfer issues, for example The president of Kazakhstan has been president for more than 20 years. He will have another one in the future. He will be older and have rights. Conditional issues, uh, and Latin America has always had difficulties with internal political stability. But, to be honest, their spillover effect is not very big. Well, even if what happens there, no one seems to care much about it, right? Just the portion is small. South Asia, I don’t know much about the future of this region. this. A lot depends on India. Whether India can maintain its growth momentum, and whether it will use the power it gains prudently, is now uncertain. I still think India will still have difficulties in the future. India, India's biggest difficulty is that its society needs reform, right? Economically it's still okay now. Now international capital is particularly optimistic about where its large amounts of hot money will go, and where international investment will go. The foreign investment it actually accepts is very close to ours. Ours is more than 100 billion U.S. dollars, and theirs is almost 100 billion U.S. dollars. But US$100 billion will have a huge impact on it, because its GDP is US$222.2 trillion, right? We are 11.11.2 trillion, which is a little more than five times. By the way, we are in the Yangtze River Delta region. I have calculated that last year our GDP in Shanghai, Zhejiang, er, Jiangsu was US$2.4 trillion. 200 billion more than India. You know, that idea ranks sixth, ahead of India. Of course, uh, this is economically and politically unified, right? That is always very powerful. This place, uh, and the structure is many times more advanced than India. The structure in India is very Lagging. Uh, so 100 billion doesn't seem to have a big effect here, but it will have a big effect on India. This, so he. He, he is the biggest problem in India. I think it is still the social structure. The entire social structure in India is still about money, the modern social structure. Its political structure is modern, right? There is modern rule of law and modern democracy, but its social structure is pre-modern, and this is its real problem. He needs society to reform land reform, which is actually very difficult. Uh, I don't know if he can overcome this, that. Uh, this article will give you a breakdown of a relatively common consensus on the Internet, uh, now. Our website and the entire public opinion in the West are particularly optimistic about India, right? Then, those who think India is very promising, that, but please go and summarize it, you will find that all those who are optimistic about India, love it, or even are obsessed with India, uh, are obsessed with India, can be called Inbuki, right Bar? Just like the person who is obsessed with Japan and buys that toilet seat is called Hibuki, right? The Japanese are blowing hard, they are all riding, and they are all mentally ill, so they are doing this and that. As for India, they all have three views. The first is that India has English. Hey, this is conducive to internationalization. Secondly, it is said that India is democratic, hey, it is politically stable. Thirdly, as for India, its population is younger than ours. They are mainly three reasons. Well. But in fact, these three major reasons can all be questioned, this. What about English? For this country, now, uh, it is good to learn from external experience as a tool, but it is not that important, because our friends in international relations all know that Japanese English is bad, right? Hey, for example, computer, in Japanese it is always pronounced computer, right? He he thought he said he had to have surgery he that. There is one thing in the history of international relations that was born when the pronunciation ability standard is 111. The Paris Agreement a hundred years ago, uh, our national spokesperson is that Gu Weijun, a famous diplomat, right? Is he a dual master's degree from Columbia University? A double master's degree in business and law, a master's degree was a big deal at that time. Having a double master's degree is awesome. He is personable and his English is very good. He got a round of applause when he spoke on it. He speaks very well. Then he finished and the Japanese representative spoke. After I finished speaking, there was no applause because no one understood it, you know. Then what? The host of the meeting was an American, an American, an American. At that time, the United States was relatively nice and better. Then he shook his hand and said, ah, you speak Japanese very much like English. The other representative from Japan said that the teacher only spoke English. This is the real world. So the Japanese language is not very good, but Japan’s modernization is very good, right? It has not affected its modernization. Hey, this is one, the language is not good, but it does not have much impact, but a counter-example is Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe is also one of the 53 members of the Commonwealth, and it is under British rule. Then I told everyone that basically all the people in Zimbabwe speak English because the local indigenous languages are too backward to adapt to modern life. He is universally speaking English. In fact, in India, there are more than 100 million people who speak English every day, including the little ones at home who have been speaking English since childhood. A very low proportion, uh, do most Indians speak Hindi? As for other languages, everyone knows that there are 15 languages on the rupee. They are all official languages. They are all spoken by people, which is quite popular. Therefore, the real English-speaking population in India is not high. Well, uh, so the English-speaking population ratio in India is not high. Of course it is, that is, India really speaks English very well. It goes without saying that it is much better than us, because its inherent advantage is that the main ancestor of all European languages is Sanskrit. You know, the Indo-European language family, the ancestor of all modern European languages is breeding, so when Indians speak nonsense, he is always right, because he is the grandfather, you know, even if he is wrong, he is right, so he is a bit This grammar is innate, and it is always correct. It's just because he, I am a grandfather, is always right, you know, so he has a little bit of an innate advantage, so once he speaks it is very standard, very good, uh, but what I just said is his actual English The population ratio is not as high as we thought. Well, basically everyone in Zimbabwe speaks English, right? But everyone knows that Zimbabwe has created a miracle in economic history. This is why Zimbabwe has the highest inflation in the world, right? The Ministry of Economy and Trade has no source of gold. Now it uses US dollars, euros and renminbi as its national currency. Then the moment he abolishes the gold dollar. Do you know how much money has been inflated? Just 100 million US dollars? Equivalent to 300 billion Zimbabwean dollars. It can't be surpassed. I think this is the pinnacle of mankind. Well, so you see that this person is good at English but he is not good at it, right? My English is not good there, but I can do okay. So English is not actually an absolute variable, you know. Hey, this can be ruled out. There is another one. Everyone likes to talk about what democracy is in India, right? Well, this is actually the case. If you look at the history of the United Kingdom, this is how the modern democracy of the British people came about. In ancient times, it had an aristocratic republic but not democracy. Democracy is modern, and it started with industrialization. What about population? Let’s work together. In the past, everyone knew that production was done by each household. It was in their own yard. Well, it was called courtyard in English, right. It was the yard where the grandfather and his son and grandson made things together. Later, it was called courtyard. Is there only a factory? That’s why everyone is so labor-intensive because they have big machines. There are big machines, and then production is concentrated in one place. Then, they just ran from the countryside to one place, to certain places. At this time, a period criticized by Marx appeared, where sheep cannibalize people. Yang Siren, in fact, capital is a process of driving people away from your land. This is a problem that he wants to create that mobile labor force. This, so this is the first stage of credit in the UK. He started this, and this has big machines for production. Everyone produces, because their production volume is very large, so people need to be concentrated there. So at this time, Kotya didn't even exist, but there was this one, now it's called factory. Well, factory workers in the modern sense began to gather in places, and then there was urbanization. It was based on this economic need, and then urbanization. After urbanization, when everyone accumulates to a certain extent, democracy will start. Why? Everyone has left the countryside, and then the protection of ordinary life is very weak. Then they will have demands for democratization. Then when democratization begins, there will be no rules. If there is chaos, they will bully whoever has the most, and they will bully others. There will be rule of law. So India India India's modern democracy. It is the product of industrialization and urbanization, not the premise, you know? Then India was colonized by the British in reverse. Then people transplanted this modern democracy and the modern rule of law from outside. Then, its industrialization and urbanization are still in progress. Then it leads to the result that its democratization is actually an obstacle to its industrialization and urbanization, rather than a positive help, right? Well, to be frank, as for the Indians, what they can really use is the third thing. India will have a larger population than us in the future. You know, the only thing that India has surpassed China is its population. This is the more obvious one. The next question comes. Having a large population is not necessarily a good thing. for a modern country. Your foundation is modern manufacturing. Modern manufacturing is determined by your industrial population, not your population. In 1937, Japan launched a full-scale invasion of China. There were 60 million people on the main island of Japan, and 500 million people on our side. We're eight to one but we can't beat him, right? The Nationalist Government fought heroically. The Communist Party has also joined in this war of resistance. We are very brave. But then, we lost half of our country, right? That is industrialization, which is actually determined by industrial population, not population, you know? Well, India has a big challenge, which is to kill its fresh population and modern industry. Oh, there are three variables here that need to be solved. As for the modern industrial population, it has three variables. First, this child must be motivated. This requires him to be willing to make progress and have a desire to work. Second, it is very important, that is, you must have working skills. First, you must have working and desire to work, and secondly, you must work. Skill requires working skills, because now the work is becoming more and more complex. If you just think that you are stupid and can move bricks, it is not suitable for modernization, you know? You must be able to communicate, understand technology, be able to manage, and have working skills. Third, you must have working, discipline, and discipline for this work. This, uh, human modernization, from one perspective, is the process of continuous improvement of human efficiency, and there are two paths to improving human efficiency, one is called technological innovation, and the other is scientific management. Well, both avenues can improve efficiency. Well. However, scientific management requires those involved in management, er, those involved in this work, to accept division of labor and discipline. right? If you don't accept discipline and point out that there is no way to divide the labor here and there, then the division of labor becomes divided, right? So you must have this to participate in this. Frankly speaking, can India turn its young workforce into meeting the three standards? It's hard to say because it has a heavy religious component. Right? Well, it is also different from the West in that places like the Mediterranean are called monotheistic religions. This is either the Jewish Yahweh, or Jehovah, or the Catholic God, or Allah is God. Anyway, they are all monotheistic religions. Then in that place, that place in South Asia, it is polytheism, so there are many gods, right? Some people exaggeratedly talked about 360 million gods, right? He has to be here every day for the rest of his life to count this wife. There are too many of these and that, so his surname is Loop, uh, so he can endure it. Right? He said that if you bully me in this life, I will bully you in the next life, so he is not worried about it. that. Well, in fact, before industrialization, our human civilization was mainly mature civilization on our Eurasian continent, right? Africa and Latin America have civilizations, but they are not mature. Mature civilizations are here, and we can industrialize them. Previous civilizations were roughly divided into three directions. Well, one was the Mediterranean civilization circle. They are a monotheistic religion that looks to the future because it has a complete personality, and if people want to live in reality, they must learn where to go. So there is another person who looks at the future, that is, the South Asian civilization circle, which is polytheistic, looks at the past, and always stands in the loop. Another one is the Chinese Civilization Circle, which looks at the present. You know, so if you hit me if the Chinese don’t suffer, I will definitely retaliate against you. The one who calculates very well is OK, but what about us Chinese? Let me tell you, that ambition is too strong, right? Hey, this has made our lives very competitive and cruel. Now we compete, starting from the mother's belly. He said that the children gave him that Mozart sticker, right? Then go to the best kindergarten in kindergarten. Ah, after coming in, grab that little red flower. The so-called kid has been a weirdo since childhood, right? We have to fight for the little red flower every day until we reach the grave, so here I tell you this. I can be too strong for three hours. It’s not a matter of not having a wall. In addition, we are working in this place, so our skills are no problem. The Chinese cultural circle attaches the greatest importance to education in the world. Except for the Jewish civilization, no other civilization can compare with ours. Mr. Cao, we attach great importance to education here. As long as it is a Chinese civilization visa, there will be school district housing. Now you are getting richer and richer, and so is he. Look at Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Because North Korea is not market-oriented now, you can’t see it. It’s all market-oriented. Let's do it right? Uh, and Vietnam now also has, uh, as long as it is in a good school district, the same house is one block away. If it is in a good school district, it will be twice as expensive. This is very. This is actually a cultural phenomenon. It seems that behind the economy is a cultural phenomenon. You know, others who also attach great importance to, uh, cultural education are the Jews. Nothing else will work. Therefore, most children in China are well educated. And the working skills are very good. that. I don't know if India can achieve this, because India's current literacy rate is very low and the illiteracy rate is very high. The literacy standards of India are very consistent. What's funny is that it is currency. Rupee, there are 15 languages. If you can sign your name in any language, you will be naked. It’s that simple. With such a low standard, an adult of 45 will not be illiterate. This is scary, right? So how do you let the new workforce have working skills? This is a big challenge, right? Hey, working desire has to compete with his religion, and then working skill has to improve its education system. There is also work working discipline, which means he must abide by discipline. Hey, this has to do with his laxity. There are traditions and there are contradictions, right? In short, if the new workforce in India in the future cannot solve these three problems, working, desire working, and skill working discipline. This is a financial burden, not wealth. Yes or no? Uh, by the way, I think that as long as they are children in the Chinese cultural circle, they are born with these three things, so they are born to be good laborers. There is evidence for this. Just look at the flow of international capital. International capital is the first to go to developed countries. Right? Because the markets of developed countries are mature, transparent and open, international capital will first go to developed countries, and the second is to East Asian countries. I don’t go to other places very much. In fact, if you go to Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and South Asia, there are so many young people and so many labor forces. Why don’t international capital go? People’s scientific and technological capital is much smarter than us intellectuals, right? People are just people. It's the one that's affordable. Because in developed countries and this place, it can make money. There is a premise that the labor force in this place is very good, right? So the conclusion is that in India, although India has a very good view, I actually think you can see it very well, but you have to come up with stronger principles. The three principles we are talking about now are that he is good at English, has democracy, and has many young people. This is not true, right? My analysis just now is enough to break their logic. right? Well. OK, I’ve talked about this a few times, including five. The relationship between major powers is more complicated. We are moving toward two superpowers. Middle powers deserve attention. Regional differentiation is another issue. Another issue is that there will be global governance issues in the future. Well, global governance is like this. It is a general background. The power of the world economy in the next ten years will still be insufficient. The world economy is particularly good. It should have been in the 1990s when the IT revolution was in full swing. As the information revolution entered this century, the power actually began to deteriorate, and it became even worse after the financial crisis. This, so this is a basic situation, that is, I personally estimate that in the next ten years there will still be no momentum equivalent to the IT revolution in the 1990s, so the entire world economic momentum is very weak. This is a big judgment call. And this one. What will appear? It's an emerging country. There will be a game between free trade and fair trade. This emerging country, like China and India, is highly competitive and plans to inherit free trade from the West, right? They advocate free trade and the overall openness of the market, because we, I, are highly competitive. However, developed countries have begun to advocate fair trade. You know, they want equal openness. They will emphasize this, so they will do this and this in the future. There are two types of countries: emerging countries and developed countries. They will use two chess pieces, one is free trade and the other is fair trade. Behind it is actually this. On the surface, it is a battle for rules, but in fact, behind it is a battle for interests. Behind international rules All are beneficial. Well, the rules are universal, but if you analyze them thoroughly later, you will find the benefits of this rule to different countries. That distribution is different, right? Well. In addition, globalization will definitely slow down in the next ten years. In the past thirty years, globalization has accelerated more and more. This situation will slow down. It may not necessarily be reversed. If the reversal is widespread, it will not be reversed, but it will slow down. There is also this, this is the global governance deficit, which is a new problem now. There is globalization only when we encounter many global problems. Uh, then the old problems will all be there, such as the polarization between rich and poor, insufficient resources, uh, uh, terrorism. These things are all there. What are the new problems? Like the Internet, the Internet brings many new problems. Oh, there are scams on the Internet and climate change. For example, Shanghai has been experiencing 40 degrees for more than ten days. This is also very rare. Climate change has brought extreme disasters. In short, this is the world now. Are the old global problems still unresolved? New questions have also been added. So, the demand for global governance is rising, but the supply of global governance is declining. Why? Because global governance is originally provided by the United States and Europe, right? Now these two brothers, hehe, are both powerless. so. When demand rises and supply falls, it means there is a global governance deficit, right? Therefore, this problem will be quite serious in the future. This also forces China to join this global governance. Alas, because if we don’t join, our own interests will be harmed. right? It’s just that global governance is more serious. the fifth. The sixth one, in terms of technology and industry, my personal calculation is this, that is, uh, due to China's joining, China's current investment in scientific research is increasing very fast. We are increasing almost every year. It’s 15. The United States is basically stagnant. Uh, Trump is still going to make cuts, but we are increasing because of our increases. Then, the overall resource investment of mankind in scientific research has increased, so I personally predict that in the future, new scientific and technological achievements will increase, and a lot of them will be produced in China. Then, there will be new business formats. In fact, the basic principles of it. By the first decade of this century, it almost stopped. What follows is development based on the original. Now I find that the Chinese are pretty good at using other people's technology. Hey, things like bike sharing, Taobao, etc. are cashless payments. They are doing pretty well now, right? What are the new four major inventions now? Apart from high-speed rail, uh, it’s industry. If I look at the others, they’re all like that. It's like a new business type. Well, there will be some new business formats coming out. But fourth. The second industrial revolution should not appear in the next ten years. It is still in the gestation period. I estimate this. And, uh, in terms of technology and industry, I have a bold idea, that is, in the next ten years, a trend may gradually emerge, that is, in terms of competition in technology and new industries, China and the United States will mainly compete. This trend It will be obvious. Hey, we should admit it now, even the best technology in the world is still in the United States, hey. What we humans can think of is the fourth industrial revolution, which is in five directions. Uh, one is this new material. Uh, now there is a new material that may be industrialized, and that is graphene, right? It seems that Tesla has developed a battery in its laboratory that can drive a car for a thousand kilometers in ten minutes of charging. He uses graphene batteries. This, so the new material industry represented by graphene is a direction. And there’s genetic engineering, right? One direction of life sciences, and another is AI, which is like an alpha dog, right? That one is smarter than humans. Of course, artificial intelligence will be, uh, a big problem in the future, that is, it is an international relations problem, a sociological problem, a philosophical problem, and it is being developed later. I don’t know how, and it may still be that way in the future. That's another question. Well, artificial intelligence may surpass humans. Well, that's another question. What about ten years from now? Artificial intelligence, everyone still regards it as controllable. The growth point of new industries will still be AI. Also, the direction our academician Pan Jianwei is pursuing is quantum, right? Quantum communications, as well as other industrialization situations, and new energy nuclear fusion. Dear, these things, it seems that now, uh, the academic community has relatively recognized that it is possible to produce new materials for the fourth industrial revolution in these five directions, right? Life science artificial intelligence uh, quantum and that new energy, right? Now it should be said that in these five major fields, the United States has the best technology. Then what is worthy of attention? It deserves attention. It belongs to the five major fields, and China has entered the second echelon. Is it true that China now has teams in these five major fields? Hey, let’s say it without humility, we are definitely on the same team as Europe and Japan and at the same level. right? Well, if we want to talk about it in detail, we should be a little stronger than them. Right? So India and Russia focus on participation, right? What about other countries? Lian can only pray for the arrangement of his future destiny, right? Yes, I probably have no idea of participating. There should be only four echelons. The United States is first, then we are in the second echelon, then Russia and India, and then the others are in the fourth echelon? that. Well. In fact, the fourth industrial revolution must have nothing to do with the fourth echelon, right? The only thing they have to do is to keep praying and do good deeds to avoid being punished by fate. Uh, me. I estimate that in the next ten years, China is likely to stand out among the second tier, leaving Europe and Japan behind. As a result, China and the United States will form a two-strong competition situation in the future technology and industry. This is . This is the sixth one. Right? Okay, the seventh one will appear, uh. The new field of international competition, related to the technology industry, is the competition of our humanity in the future. In addition to the traditional land, sea and air, we will also enter new fields, that is, the Internet. auspicious. Space and deep sea. It’s us humans. The fields they develop will increase, and then everyone will develop them, so there will be competition. right? Therefore, the areas that humans have opened up have increased, and then the areas for competition have increased. In addition to the land, sea and air in the traditional sense, there will definitely be new games in these four directions, the network, the polar space, the deep sea, right? This is second. The seventh one, right? The eighth political stability issue is what will happen in the next ten years? how to say? Political stability is very difficult for all countries, uh, but compared with the past ten years, it is difficult for both the East and the West. In the past ten years, everyone should have the impression that it was still more difficult for non-Western countries. For example, there were color revolutions in Central and Eastern Europe, and then there was the Arab Spring in Arabia. Well, the West is still stable, but the main reason is that the non-West is less stable. I think the next ten years will be very difficult for both the West and non-Western countries. In the West, there is a problem now that the mainstream is divided. The mainstream is called Main Street, right? The mainstream is dividing, and the populist elite is dividing. This elite used to dominate various resources, but now we can see from the Trump phenomenon and Brexit that populism has emerged in the West. This, and then the contradiction between the populists and the elites appeared within them, and there was also this more extreme contradiction between the left and the right. Right? last year in the United States. Well, Trump, the real estate developer president, was elected, but please note that there is another person worthy of attention, that is Sanders of the Democratic Party on the left. right? The other person he pulled away first was this industrial group. Conflicts with virtual economic groups will rise. This guy like Trump actually represents an industrial group, right? He is a little skeptical about the virtual economy. In the past ten years, the virtual economy has dominated the United States. This, so. At least these three contradictions can be seen from the British, American and European elections last year. There are three major contradictions between populism and elites, left and right, industry and virtual economy. The conclusion is that the mainstream in the West is dividing. The mainstream is dividing, which will lead to political instability in the West. Because a prerequisite for multi-party democracy is that it is very strong without instruments . The mainstream is very strong and then splits into different factions. At this time, multi-party democracy can be fought without breaking. But if the mainstream loses multi-party democracy, then there will be a real war , and then there will be a civil war. You know, there will be a real war. So now Western multi-party democracy has encountered problems with its social premise, which is the mainstream division. Okay, what about the non-Western? this. In the past ten years, many places have been unstable, and they will still be unstable in the next ten years, because there are so many airplanes in other developing countries. What are their problems? Once it urbanizes, as many countries are urbanizing, urbanization itself will bring political impact, right? It turns out they are all in rural areas, where people are quite scattered. Not only is it easy to organize, it can lead to criminal offenses. However, it is difficult to launch a political movement, but once you get to the city, after urbanization, your political consciousness will rise, your demands will increase, and your organizational capabilities will also be strengthened. Urbanization is a necessary step for modernization. But from a political perspective, it will cause problems. Universal education. Well, after education is popularized, people's political demands will increase. There is also the emergence of a middle class, and now all emerging countries and other less developed countries will now face this problem. Urbanizing the middle class and expanding the popularization of education, well, these are all things that modernization must do, but they all have political pressure. this. In addition, there is an impact on both the West and non-Western countries, and that is the impact of the Internet, right? The Internet will bring about two worlds. A real world and a virtual world, right? In the virtual world, there are very fun things, but there are also many very extreme things. Well, many people go online in a very gentle way in their daily lives, and it seems like they have become a different person, right? It has become extremely neurotic. Well, OK, this is the political stability of various countries, and the cost of maintaining it is higher than before. Before, it was mostly non-Western. right? We encountered the Arab Spring, a color revolution, but we will also have this problem within the West in the future. Then there is the clash of civilizations. this. What about Clash of Civilizations? I call it the War of the Gods. This is based on interests, but goes beyond interests in general. For example, if we are from the same civilization, our conflicts are mainly conflicts of real interests, right? So if we are different gods, in addition to actual conflicts of interest, what about conflicts between gods? You know, the spiritual father in my mind, this is the spiritual father that Professor Wen talked about, and I beat him to protect the spiritual father, so the person is a little crazy, right? It was originally a conflict of interest for me, and everyone’s interests can be calculated. right? Forget it, then make arrangements to solve it. The war of the gods needs to be introduced, which is quite troublesome. The one that’s quite difficult to solve? Well, the clash of civilizations is the war of the gods, right? This is based on interests, but goes beyond interests, then. In the next ten years, the conflict of internal civilizations and the conflict of external civilizations will interweave. Well, the conflicts of internal civilizations will mainly be concentrated in Europe. right? There are more and more refugees in Europe, and among them, Islam accounts for a large proportion. Then, it will cause a backlash from mainstream European society. right? Then the conflict of civilizations within Europe will become serious, and it will also happen in the United States, but it will be controllable, um, but in Europe this problem will be very serious. Then there is the conflict of external civilizations. The conflicts of external civilizations mainly occur in two places, one is the Western world and Islam, and the other is India and Islam. I think this will be very prominent. Okay, the last trend is that non-traditional security issues will become more severe in the next ten years based on the past. Well, there are so many here. Currents of thought, first of all, current trends of thought are very extreme. In this future, I personally estimate that there will be a struggle between two universal values. A universal value in the 21st century is American, right? It is this universal value of mine that represents the advanced direction. There is another one, the seventh century universal value, right? Muhammad, he said that you are all a bunch of fools, it was done by elements, that does not count. This is what the saint said, and this is the universal value. So later. That online salary talks about universal values. If you ask him if he returns late, he will tell you which one it is. You know, that one is because there are 1.6 billion people there. right? The appeal is also quite powerful. right ? That is our Chinese character. This company has a weakness. The human race in its eyes is the West. Isn't it because he is a bit inappropriate for non-Western people? In fact, he is a racist, and he wants to be a real racist. Hey, look what they are talking about is China and the world, and this world is the West. Well, the war between China and the West actually accounts for more than half of the human race. The West is only 15, we are only 20, 35 and 2/3. Human beings are not human in their eyes, you know. He excludes him from the entire analytical framework, excludes him. Isn't it cruel? It's very cruel. You must ask him when you argue with him from now on. Hey, when it comes to universal values, you must ask Hui Qiwan, uh, which one it is. You can't say that there were 1.16 billion tourists at that time. They are no longer human beings, so OK, this is a trend of thought, and it will become quite divisive in the future, I think. These, especially those two markets, are the two universal values of the seventh century and the 21st century. That, and to be honest, no one can convince anyone. Heck I'm older now, when I was younger I believed debate could solve problems, now I see that debate doesn't solve problems at all. As for a person, after forming his own values, he will be stubborn and will not change them. It won't change at all. When you get sick, you will feel hurt and angry later. If you want to convince the other party, you won't be able to do so. You know, you know how people change? It's his values. Let him do things. If he fails, his values will affect you. Just trying to reason with her is useless. Only practice can educate him. OK, this is me, and I infer that the ideological trends in the future will be more divided than in the past ten years. Then, the immigration and refugee problem will become more serious. I think this cannot be changed, and immigrants and refugees will be even worse. There are also three forces: terrorism, extremism and separatism. It will remain the same, it will exist, and maybe it will be even more powerful. Well, I don’t quite understand the truth, but I guess it seems to me that the three forces not only exist, but will become more powerful. right? Competition among ideological trends is more severe, immigrants and refugees are more serious, and the three types of strength are more powerful. Well, food security is an old problem. There is hope that we can do a better job in that. We, China, will start to get involved in global governance, right? From 2015, I personally think that in October of 2015, we, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, had a collective study and invited Qin Yaqing, the dean of the Foreign Affairs University. It’s remarkable that the teacher talks about globalization. This is a serious sign that we are interested in global global governance, so China is a country with super strong action capabilities, right? So after we go in, I personally estimate that we will be better than the West in solving some problems, including food. What about food? That's right. What about food? In fact, there is no problem with production. This is based on our current food growing technology as humans, uh, thank you for our current food growing technology. Well, with existing cultivated land, humans can actually feed 15 billion people. Then the latest statistics of our current human population is that half of the 7.6 billion people are human, right? So there should be no hunger problem. Up to now, there is still a problem of hunger. That’s it. There are now 860 million people. In a biological sense, there are African and Latin Americans who are hungry. For example, Haiti is very close to the United States. he. We Chinese have now forgotten that he just doesn’t have enough to eat, right? Because since the reform and opening up, we have solved the problem of food through industrialization, uh, industrial technology. Now we are definitely full and have no problem. What we mainly want to eat is safety, because this seems to be unsafe. ,Right? It’s okay to be full, eh. I guess eating is not a problem in a place like Shanghai, right? Your problem is that after eating something so delicious, girls want to take care of their bodies, and then they want to eat it and feel guilty after eating it, right? Then work out like crazy, right? It's rare that we have a good meal next time. Uh, we've solved this problem, right? We just want to eat well and healthily, but let me tell you, there are 8.6 billion people in the world who do not have enough to eat in a biological sense. This is a pretty good one. I think this is a case of global governance failure, but I, I, I, I hope, hey, and I also believe that with China's intervention in global governance, this problem will be solved. Hey, British people, when it comes to the problem of feeding humans, our city is the biggest one in China. right? OK, so this problem is a good one, that is, the trend of thought will become more intensified, so your immigration will be more serious, and the three groups of forces will be more serious, but I tend to think that food security will get better, because it is actually a distribution. The question is, isn’t it a production problem? Is the production enough? If the distribution is not good, then after China intervenes and improves the distribution efficiency, I think the 39 problem will be alleviated. What about the resource problem? that. Well. I can’t make a final conclusion about the two trends now. I can only say that the two trends coexist at the same time. One, the industrialization of China, the industrialization of India, and the industrialization of Africa will bring about an increase in demand for resources, right? It's natural to become more nervous. But what about the other side? Because of technological progress, especially China's technological progress, it is possible that the resource problem can be alleviated. It is two things competing. Right? Well, I can only say that I look forward to it. I hope that our renewable energy will grow at a faster rate than, uh, the industrial population's demand for resources. That'll make it easier. Hey, this is a positive cycle. China should play a better role in solving resource problems in this process. That last one is, uh, the next ten years, uh. It's us humans. Solving the problem of climate control and climate change is critical. If we work together. This is to achieve low-carbon growth, right? The economy is growing, but carbon emissions must be controlled. If we can do this and that, especially starting from China. This, then we have great hope in controlling climate change in the future. Well. But if that is not done well, then this problem may become very serious in the future. OK, this is my prediction on ten aspects of this, uh, future world. Uh, it’s a very rough and very personal prediction. But anyway, after I put it forward, there will be targets for discussion one by one. You can refine and correct this based on this. I will stop sharing my opinions with you here. It’s a bit overdue. Thank you, everyone. Thank you.
